<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved exploring nature on a good hike, whether it be with other people, my dog, or solo. Hiking builds both physique and mental clarity, and the &ldquo;hiker&rsquo;s high&rdquo; is pure bliss.</p>
<p>There are many things I&rsquo;ve learned over the years that have helped me maximize my own hiking experience. Some I learned from trial-and-error, while others I learned from fellow hikers, my own physician, or from online hiking forums. This post summarizes all of them using six tips. You can also find a list of my recommended trails <a href="../../trails">here</a>.</p>
<p>In general, I&rsquo;m drawn to more difficult hikes that contain varied landscape and big variations in elevation for cardio. Since I prefer hikes that take 4-6 hours to complete, the advice I&rsquo;m giving in this post is geared towards hikes of that timeframe.</p>
<h1 id="1-obtain-the-right-gear">1. Obtain the right gear</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of using less gear over more. Proper hiking shoes (with socks) and a hat are a must, as is a backpack that can carry vital supplies. While others online recommend hiking sticks, I think they distract from the hiking experience. As a result, I only use a single collapsible hiking stick for those rare hikes that traverse narrow/steep hills on rainy or snowy days where foot traction and weight shifting aren&rsquo;t enough to prevent slipping.</p>
<p>For hiking shoes, I recommend ones that are durable and breathable. They should have a combination of leather or suede and mesh, as well as a thick sole with good traction. It&rsquo;s also important to choose ones that have the proper width, toe room, and arch support for your feet. For me, KEEN Voyageurs (1) meet all of these criteria.</p>
<p>Any hat will do as long as it keeps bugs and sun off your head. I prefer wearing stretch fit ball caps (2) when hiking.</p>
<p>When it comes to a backpack, I&rsquo;m a big fan of sling backpacks (3) because they are lighter, easier to slip on, and more comfortable on longer hikes compared to traditional backpacks. I find you have to go to a large outdoor store (e.g., <a href="https://www.sail.ca/en/">Sail</a>) and try several of them on to find one that fits you well. The key is to ensure that it has enough compartments and room for the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>A large (32oz/1L) durable water bottle. I prefer a Nalgene (4).</li>
<li>A small (12oz/354mL) coffee/tea tumbler with a tight-fit cap. I prefer a YETI Rambler (5) because they never leak.</li>
<li>2 high protein / low carb bars. I recommend QUEST bars (6) with 20g of protein and 4g or less of net carbs.</li>
<li>Suntan lotion. Any brand, as long as it&rsquo;s SPF 50 or more and in a durable plastic container (7).</li>
<li>DEET-based bug spray in a small pump bottle that provides 6 or more hours of protection. I prefer Muskol (8).</li>
<li>Phone. I prefer Android (9) but iPhones are a somewhat acceptable substitute.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="gear.jpg#center" alt="Hiking gear" title="Hiking gear"></p>
<p>If you are hiking with a dog, ensure you also have enough room for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dog water bottle/dispenser that holds enough water for the size of your dog.</li>
<li>Dog poop bags.</li>
<li>Low carb dog treats in a smaller Ziploc bag.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="2-plan-your-hike">2. Plan your hike</h1>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve done gone on unplanned hikes before, it&rsquo;s not something I recommend doing &ndash; especially for longer hikes. Moreover, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that you&rsquo;ll be able to get cellular reception to download a map or obtain accurate location information of where you are hiking.</p>
<p>Thus, it&rsquo;s important to understand where you are going beforehand. This means spending a considerable amount of time analyzing a trail map online using a desktop or laptop PC with a large screen a day or two before the hike. Note the key trail areas, visible landmarks, and water bodies, as well as any boundaries or roads. Familiarize yourself with parts of the trail by looking at pics others have posted online, if possible.</p>
<p>After this, you&rsquo;ll want to ensure that you bring a copy of the trail map with you. If you&rsquo;re hiking a provincial park, conservation area, or larger trail (e.g., the Bruce Trail), then the associated website will likely have a trail map you can download on your PC and send to your phone beforehand.  Alternatively, you can search the trail on <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/">AllTrails</a>, <a href="https://www.trailforks.com/">Trailforks</a>, or Google Maps. Save a screenshot of the trail map from these sites on your PC and send it to your phone.</p>
<h1 id="3-prepare-yourself-physically-for-the-hike">3. Prepare yourself physically for the hike</h1>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever gone on a hike and felt exhausted shortly into your hike, it&rsquo;s likely because you didn&rsquo;t prepare your body for the hike itself.</p>
<p>The night before your hike, go for a long walk around your neighbourhood. Just before bed, drink a whey protein shake to ensure your body is burning calories evenly throughout the night. Then, first thing the next morning, have another whey protein shake. If you&rsquo;d like to eat breakfast after that shake, focus on high-fiber, low-carb food. No fruits (except raspberries), no toast, no muffins, and no potatoes (starch). Bacon and eggs are fine, as are other low-carb treats such as kale chips or roasted seaweed snacks.</p>
<p>Next, boost your metabolism. The easiest way to do this is to drink a black coffee before heading out. If you don&rsquo;t like coffee, try a black tea that has high caffeine content, such as Earl Grey.</p>
<h1 id="4-use-a-routine-to-get-gear-ready-the-day-of-the-hike">4. Use a routine to get gear ready the day of the hike</h1>
<p>To ensure you don&rsquo;t forget anything you need for your hike, create a preparation routine. Keeping most or all of your hiking gear in a certain area of your home also helps with this. For example, I always prepare my sling backpack using the following routine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fill my 32oz/1L Nalgene with tap water and put it in my backpack</li>
<li>Add 2 QUEST bars and Ziploc bad of dog treats next to the Nalgene</li>
<li>Add suntan lotion, bug spray, and dog poop bags to front pocket of the backpack</li>
<li>Add phone to the phone holder of the backpack</li>
<li>Add dog water bottle and YETI tumbler (full of coffee) to the side pouches of the backpack</li>
<li>Put on backpack, hat, and hiking shoes</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="5-sustain-energy-and-hydration">5. Sustain energy and hydration</h1>
<p>To sustain even energy levels during your hike, eat one protein bar within the first 30-40 min of your hike with coffee/tea. To keep the &ldquo;hiker&rsquo;s high&rdquo; for many hours afterwards and build muscle mass, eat the second protein bar about 30-40 min before the end of your hike, also with coffee/tea.</p>
<p>Drink water only when you feel you need to, not just at times when you need a break. Your body will tell you when you need water, and you should only drink enough water to satisfy that need. However, if you&rsquo;re hiking with a dog, be sure to offer your dog water during each break if they haven&rsquo;t recently helped themselves to a drink in a nearby river, stream, or lake.</p>
<h1 id="6-avoid-using-your-phone-during-the-hike">6. Avoid using your phone during the hike</h1>
<p>Hiking is all about enjoying the moment in nature. There&rsquo;s no shortage of stuff to take in. Keep your phone in your sling backpack and forget about it. Don&rsquo;t listen to music with earbuds, don&rsquo;t take a bazillion pics of everything, and don&rsquo;t touch social media.</p>
<p>The only times you should take your phone out of your backpack is to view the trail map or take a pic of something significant you want to capture for later, such as wildlife, a stunning lake view, or the overlook from a summit.</p>
