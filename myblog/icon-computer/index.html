<p>Nicknamed the <em><strong>bionic beaver</strong></em>, the ICON was a Canadian computer funded by the Ontario government and used in schools province wide. It was designed by CEMCorp (Canadian Educational Microprocessor Corporation) and manufactured by Burroughs (later renamed to Unisys). Moreover, it ran the QNX UNIX-like operating system, which was also developed in Canada by two University of Waterloo students.
<img src="ICON.jpg#right" alt="ICON" title="ICON"></p>
<p>If you took a computer programming course in high school during the 1980s or early 1990s, you likely remember learning C, BASIC or Pascal on the ICON, as well as many UNIX commands that would pay off later in college or university. If you didn&rsquo;t, you probably remember the ICON as a cool looking steel monstrosity that had an indestructible keyboard and trackball (that everyone tried to spin as fast as they could).</p>
<p>My high school had a room full of ICONs tucked away in the basement, but you had to pass through two other rooms full of brand new IBM PCs in order to get to it. The ICON room was dedicated to learning computer programming only, which is one thing these underpowered computers did well. After all, ICONs only had 512 KB of RAM, a 7.16 MHz 80186 CPU, and absolutely NO local storage (NO hard drive, NO floppy drive). When you booted an ICON, it downloaded the QNX operating system from a LEXICON file server in the corner of the room via a 2.5 Mbit/s ARCNET coaxial network. After QNX booted into RAM on your system, you could log in and access your home directory on the LEXICON or run programs that were installed on the LEXICON. Up to 16 ICONs could be connected to a single LEXICON in an ARCNET cluster (LAN).</p>
<p>The LEXICON (discussed in my next blog post) was a boring square-ish box that had nearly identical hardware specifications as an ICON, but also contained a disk controller that provided access to a hard drive (for storing QNX, programs and user files) and a single floppy drive.</p>
<p>If you wanted to save your work to a floppy, you had to go to the LEXICON, put in your floppy, go back to your ICON, run a command that copied the file from your home directory on the LEXICON&rsquo;s hard drive to the floppy, and then retrieve your floppy from the LEXICON. This process was widely considered too much exercise for any kid enrolled in a computer programming class back then.</p>
<p>Because the ICON was a government initiative, by the time it got to market in 1984, there were already IBM-compatible systems on the market with more RAM, the more powerful 80286 CPU, and local storage for the same cost. Moreover, those systems could run DOS and had a massive library of software applications as a result. The ICON had very few available software applications.</p>
<p>All of this meant that the ICON was widely seen as a waste of public money. In addition to the cost of the ARCNET network, LEXICON file server, and software programs, the cost of each ICON at the time was $2500. However, school boards only had to pay $495, and the government covered the remainder with a grant. After heavy criticism for a decade, the government ceased all support for the ICON in 1994 and ordered all ICON hardware to be sent to landfill and software to be destroyed. Luckily, a few ICONs and software survived the purge, and I was fortunate to get one from an old teacher via a friend ;-)</p>
<h1 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h1>
<p>The ports on the rear are shown below. There&rsquo;s two additional 115V AC outlets (one is used for the EGA monitor), a video port that connects to the monitor (with room for a second), two coaxial BNC ports for the network to allow for the chaining of ICONs in a classroom environment (otherwise one of the connectors must have a terminator), an external keyboard port and three blanking plates for future use (RS232 serial and parallel):</p>
<p><img src="ICON_ports.jpg#center" alt="ICON ports" title="ICON ports"></p>
<p>The ICON monitor is on a swivel mount and can be detached from the base by removing 4 screws:</p>
<p><img src="ICON_monitor_removed.jpg#center" alt="ICON monitor removed" title="ICON monitor removed"></p>
<p>Removing another dozen screws from the base allows you to detach the heavy metal top assembly (including the keyboard and trackball) and expose the power supply (1), motherboard (2), external keyboard port (3), video port (4), coaxial BNC ports (5), volume control (6) and headphone jack (7):</p>
<p><img src="ICON_open.jpg#center" alt="ICON open" title="ICON open"></p>
<p>After unplugging all of the Molex connectors, the motherboard is easy to remove. It contains 512KB of TMS4164 RAM chips (1), two AMD P8255A-5 I/O controllers (2), a 2.5 Mbit/s SMC COM9026 network controller (3), a Hitachi HD46505SP video controller (4), two AM27128ADC system ROMs (5), a TMS5220CNL speech synthesizer (6), and an Intel R80186 CPU (7):</p>
<p><img src="ICON_motherboard.jpg#center" alt="ICON motherboard" title="ICON motherboard"></p>
<p>The R80186 CPU is held in place using a metal plate. After removing this plate, you can see the CPU and the gold contacts on the reverse:</p>

<h1 id="the-qnx-operating-system">The QNX operating system</h1>
<p>QNX was one of the first commercial microkernel-based UNIX-like operating systems. And while it was like other UNIX, Linux and macOS systems, there were many aspects that were unique to the ICON.</p>
<p>File paths used the following format: <code>[node]drive:/path</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>node</code> is the network node number of the LEXICON file server. The first LEXICON file server has a node number of 1, the second has a node number of 2, and so on. Since most classrooms used a single LEXICON only, the node number could safely be omitted to use the default of 1.</li>
<li><code>drive</code> is the storage device on the LEXICON (1=hard disk, 2=floppy, 8=RAM disk that stored QNX for copying to ICONs). If you don&rsquo;t specify the drive, it assumes 1.</li>
<li><code>/path</code> is the UNIX path on that storage device. For example, <code>/user/jason/report.txt</code> is the report.txt file under the jason directory under the user directory under the root directory. Each student had a user account on the LEXICON, with a home directory under <code>/user</code> that they could use to store files.</li>
</ul>
<p>QNX file names could be up to 16 characters and were case sensitive. Programs installed on the hard drive of the LEXICON were included in a search path and could be run by executing their name (e.g. running <code>basic</code> at a command prompt would start Watcom BASIC if it was installed).</p>
<p>Most UNIX commands and features (e.g. redirection) were the same in QNX, but there were some notable exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>man</code> command did not exist to get manual pages for commands. Instead, you could view the usage and options for a command by passing it the <code>?</code> argument (e.g. <code>date ?</code> would display the usage and options for the <code>date</code> command).</li>
<li>There was no long listing option for the <code>ls</code> command. Instead, directory names in the output of <code>ls</code> were prefixed with a <code>+</code> symbol (e.g. <code>+jason</code> indicated the jason subdirectory).</li>
<li><code>^</code> was used instead of <code>../</code> when referring to parent directories. For example, if your current directory is <code>/user/jason</code> and you want to change to the <code>/user/jennifer directory</code>, you could run the <code>cd ^jennifer</code> command to change to the jennifer directory under your parent directory.</li>
<li>The <code>/cmds</code> directory was used instead of <code>/bin</code> to store executable binaries and was automatically included in the search path.</li>
<li>There was no <code>/etc</code> directory. Instead, <code>/config</code> stored system configuration, <code>/sys</code> stored QNX operating system binaries, and <code>/util</code> stored QNX daemons.</li>
<li>The <code>task</code> command was used to list processes instead of <code>ps</code> and labelled processes differently. Parent processes were labelled &ldquo;father&rdquo;, child processes were labelled &ldquo;son&rdquo;, and child processes started by the same parent were labelled &ldquo;brother&rdquo;.</li>
<li>There was no <code>chmod</code> command for setting file permissions. Instead, <code>chattr</code> was used to set all file attributes, including permission attributes.</li>
<li>The <code>apb</code> (all points bulletin) command was used instead of <code>wall</code> (warn all) for sending text messages to all system users. When executed by an ICON user, it sent a message to all ICON workstations connected to the same LEXICON (endless fun in a classroom that usually landed you in trouble with the teacher).</li>
<li>The epoch was January 1st 1980 (instead of January 1st 1970).</li>
</ul>
<p>To install software on the hard drive of the LEXICON from a floppy disk, you performed these steps:
<img src="ICON_software.jpg#right" alt="ICON software" title="ICON software"></p>
<ul>
<li>Insert the first floppy disk of the program into the floppy drive on the LEXICON.</li>
<li>Power on one of the ICON systems and let it boot QNX from the LEXICON. Once booted, log into QNX as <code>root</code> (default password = <code>superuser</code>), which was what the teacher usually logged in as.</li>
<li>At the shell prompt, run <code>print 2:/READ_ME</code> if you wanted to read the contents of the READ_ME file on the floppy (optional, but often listed on the floppy as shown here).</li>
<li>At the shell prompt, run <code>2:/install</code> to run the installation script on the floppy (alternatively, you could run <code>cd 2:/</code> to switch to the root directory on the floppy and then type <code>install</code>).</li>
<li>The installation script would prompt you for remaining tasks (including when to insert the second floppy disk). Once software was installed on the LEXICON, any ICON user could execute it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following video, I boot QNX on the ICON from a LEXICON file server across an ARCNET network and walk through many of the QNX concepts discussed in this post: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn0SIteAe1k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn0SIteAe1k</a></p>
<h1 id="so-why-was-the-icon-important">So why was the ICON important?</h1>
<p>Firstly, it was the system that many Ontarians used to learn how to program. While my high school just taugh C, Pascal and BASIC on them, ICONs could also be used to learn Logo, Turing, Fortran, Cobol and APL. Some schools also used them for teaching typing and word processing, or for educational games (especially elementary schools).</p>
<p><img src="ICON_languages.jpg#center" alt="ICON languages" title="ICON languages"></p>
<p>Secondly, the ICON directly led to the success of QNX. The ICON and LEXICON were QNX&rsquo;s first big commercial application and demonstrated that QNX was very stable. This, in turn, led to QNX&rsquo;s adoption by many different embedded systems manufacturers. BlackBerry bought QNX in 2010 and used it for their BlackBerry 10 smartphones and Playbook tablet before switching to Android and ultimately leaving the smartphone market altogether. Today, QNX is used in many newer cars that have touchscreen navigation and controls (including my Ford Edge).</p>
<p>Thirdly and most importantly, the ICON looked cool. It was truly an iconic computer to anyone who grew up in Ontario during the 1980s.</p>
