<p>There are plenty of blog posts on the Web that give sage advice for anyone working in the tech industry. However, most of them focus on the same topics: time management, resourcefulness, continuous learning, verbal and written communication skills, caffeine consumption, and so on.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I&rsquo;ll discuss 6 tech industry tips that are rarely discussed online, but that are equally (if not more) important from my experience over the past three decades in this industry.</p>
<h1 id="1-approach-change-carefully">1. Approach change carefully</h1>
<p>Often disguised as &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; for buy-in, all change has the potential to alienate people and cause problems. In order to mitigate the chance of this happening, focus on user experience (often called UX) when making decisions, instead of other factors that satisfy one or a few other people or processes within your organization.</p>
<p>Secondly, attack your change ideas and approach from every angle. When you find a fault, don&rsquo;t just ditch the idea or approach - try to find a solution. Around 90% of the time this isn&rsquo;t possible and you just have to ditch it, but trying builds vital analytical skills that are transferable to other problems.</p>
<h1 id="2-take-responsibility-for-failure">2. Take responsibility for failure</h1>
<p>While it has traditionally been discouraged within corporate culture, taking responsibility for failure builds trust and respect with those people who matter (if those people don&rsquo;t exist in the organization, you should probably switch organizations ;-)</p>
<h1 id="3-study-your-mistakes">3. Study your mistakes</h1>
<p>Failed projects/tasks are an opportunity for learning and growth. Before moving on, spend a large amount of time to analyze the timeline of events from a failed project/task and identify the root causes of failure at each part. Personal bias is often a major contributor to failure because we tend to be optimistic that something will succeed even if there are red flags indicating otherwise. To identify bias, ask yourself questions like &ldquo;Would I recommend this in a different situation?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Am I hoping that this will work for personal reasons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Think about mistakes you&rsquo;ve identified for a few days, and discuss them with others to get their perspective. Once you are satisfied that you understand exactly why a particular project/task failed, you&rsquo;re far less likely to make the same mistakes in the future.</p>
<h1 id="4-know-and-stick-to-your-personal-values">4. Know and stick to your personal values</h1>
<p>Values are a key personal trait, and it&rsquo;s important to be aware of your own. Spend some time thinking about your personal values on a periodic basis (because they can change over time as you grow). Identifying your values is often easier if you start by identifying your mentors. Mentors are people whose opinions you value - they could be coworkers, managers, friends, family members, teachers, and so on.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve identified your values, stick to them. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to let others know that you&rsquo;re not willing to do something because it is against a particular value that you hold. This builds integrity and respect with others (and with yourself). Knowing other people&rsquo;s values is equally valuable, and will allow you to work together in a productive and respectful way.</p>
<h1 id="5-dont-accept-criticism-from-everyone">5. Don&rsquo;t accept criticism from everyone</h1>
<p>Know who you should accept criticism from in any situation. Accept criticism from people you respect, or who have adequate knowledge specifically related to the criticism itself. Reject criticism from all others, letting the person know why (lack of subject matter knowledge, misdirected, etc.). Of course, you may still disagree with the criticism you accept ;-)</p>
<h1 id="6-stay-active">6. Stay active</h1>
<p>Your physical health is closely tied to your mental health. The tech industry can be stressful at times, and this often translates to less physical exercise. Regular workouts, morning runs, or taking long walks during a lunch break or downtime can dramatically decrease your stress levels, as well improve cognition, productivity and happiness!</p>
