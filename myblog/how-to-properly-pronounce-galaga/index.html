<p>I’ve been getting some heat over the past short while when I talk about my Galaga arcade, because there are 2 different camps when it comes to pronouncing the word Galaga.  You can either emphasize the first syllable:</p>
<pre><code>    GAL-a-ga
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can emphasize the second syllable:</p>
<pre><code>    ga-LAG-a
</code></pre>
<p>I’ve always emphasized the second syllable (ga-LAG-a).  However, the Avengers movie came out this year, and Robert Downey Jr. (who plays Iron Man in the movie) pronounced the game as GAL-a-ga when it showed up in the movie.  So now, most people say something along the lines of “oh you mean GAL-a-ga” when I mention my ga-LAG-a machine.  Annoying as hell to say the least&hellip;..</p>
<p>So I had to find out what the “official” pronunciation of Galaga was (I actually lost sleep over this stupid thing).</p>
<p>An exhaustive search of the Internet turned up three things about the pronunciation of Galaga:</p>
<ol>
<li>Namco doesn’t give a damn about how it is pronounced.</li>
<li>There is roughly a 50/50 split between the two camps on Internet forums - with most acknowledging that they hear GAL-a-ga more often than ga-LAG-a.</li>
<li>Most videos on Youtube (even ones from the early 80s) pronounce it GAL-a-ga.</li>
</ol>
<p>No answer there.  So I thought for a while and came up with a good solution.  Namco likely communicated using their preferred pronunciation of Galaga with Midway (the company who distributed the game in North America).  So, if I could talk with someone who worked for Midway distributing Galaga machines back in 1981 and ask them how it was pronounced at the time, I’d have a pretty reliable answer and could then put the issue to rest.</p>
<p>The problem was a bit harder than I anticipated because:</p>
<ol>
<li>1981 was a long time ago, and many of these people are dead or retired or senile.</li>
<li>Those who aren’t dead or retired or senile, probably don’t spend much time on the Internet.</li>
</ol>
<p>After 2 weeks of searching arcade forums (and pinball forums), I found someone whose father (Walter Perks) was a Midway distributor for 4 states in the Southeastern U.S. from the late 1970s until the early 1990s.  I got his number and called him at home.  Long story short, he was a super nice guy, and not only gave me the answer I was looking for, but TOLD ME WHY!  Awesome!</p>
<p>The correct pronunciation of Galaga emphasizes the second syllable (ga-LAG-a) for one simple reason - it was the direct successor to Galaxian (which was also pronounced with emphasis on the second syllable ga-LAX-i-an).  He says everyone at Midway pronounced it that way from the time it was introduced on their channel sales call, and arcade operators did as well in order to keep related/similar games straight.  However, he also mentioned that within a few years afterwards, the GAL-a-ga pronunciation became so popular among customers (for whatever reason) that most people started pronouncing it GAL-a-ga.</p>
<p>Good enough proof for me.  I think it is best to pronounce it the original way: ga-LAG-a.    Plus, I’m quite happy to have been pronouncing it the correct way my entire life.  For those who have been pronouncing it as GAL-a-ga, I offer my sincere apologies ;-)</p>
