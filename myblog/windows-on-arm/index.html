    <p><img src="desktop.png#center" alt="Copilot+ PC Desktop" title="Copilot+ PC Desktop"></p>
<p>Back in 2017, I wrote a <a href="../get-ready-for-the-chip-wars/">blog post</a> predicting intense competition between Intel- and ARM-based PCs. And finally, after many years of lukewarm development efforts on the part of Microsoft and Qualcomm, that competition is here with Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs running powerful ARM-based Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite CPUs with built in graphics and AI acceleration.</p>
<p>As shown in the desktop screenshot at the top of this post I&rsquo;ve been using a Copilot+ PC as a productivity and development workstation this month, and I must say that I&rsquo;m thoroughly impressed overall. In this blog post, I&rsquo;ll outline why.</p>
<h1 id="they-are-insanely-fast">They are insanely fast</h1>
<p>The most distinctive feature of Copilot+ PCs is that they are <em><strong>unbelievably</strong></em> fast for a Windows system. Apps seem to open instantaneously, and operations such as large file copies seem to take half compared to the most powerful Intel-based PCs. Even the Search box immediately finds files buried anywhere on the system and sorts them by relevance.</p>
<p>The 12 Oryon CPU cores in the Snapdragon X Elite seem to take anything I can throw at them. Running Teams, Outlook (in Edge), two Linux virtual machines, Visual Studio Code, GitHub Desktop, and Slack simultaneously uses under 10% of the CPU most of the time on my system:</p>
<p><img src="taskmgr.png#center" alt="Task Manager" title="Task Manager"></p>
<h1 id="the-ai-features-are-mostly-good">The AI features are <em>mostly</em> good</h1>
<p><em><strong>Copilot</strong></em> is quite good at generating useful results with references and links, and the integration into Windows feel natural. It returns results almost immediately, and noticeably faster than within a web browser. The first time you click the Copilot button, it asks you for your name and what voice style you prefer for the Copilot assistant.</p>
<p><em><strong>Live Captions</strong></em> is also a useful feature that I didn&rsquo;t expect I would use as much as I do. It does a fairly accurate job of captioning anything you&rsquo;re watching in a grey bar at the top of your desktop and understands even the heaviest of accents. The first time you use it, it will download a large number of language files.</p>
<p>While the image and video editing enhancements are excellent, the AI image generation in Paint is hilariously bad. It seems to be stuck in the early days of image generation (e.g., 6 fingers on a hand, dogs with different sized legs), but it&rsquo;s better than nothing and probably OK for very simple images. It runs off of a locally-installed AI model.</p>
<p><em><strong>Recall</strong></em> and <em><strong>Click to Do</strong></em> are available in preview to Windows Insiders right now. Recall generates a detailed and accurate timeline of nearly any file and app activity but isn&rsquo;t a feature that those of us who organize everything on our PC may find useful. Click to Do, on the other hand, is quite useful. It provides quick actions for anything on your screen &ndash; even if it&rsquo;s part of a picture.</p>
<h1 id="app-compatibility-is-excellent">App compatibility is excellent</h1>
<p>Because Windows is relatively new to the ARM architecture, most Windows apps are written for Intel instead of ARM. Of course, many of the major apps are written natively for ARM, including Edge, Chrome, Visual Studio Code, Teams and Office 365, but the developers of most other apps likely haven&rsquo;t spent much time thinking of providing an ARM version.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this wasn&rsquo;t a big problem at all for me since the Intel emulation performed on the Snapdragon X Elite was excellent. Every Intel app I installed had zero issues and actually ran faster than on my Intel-based PC. Even the most obscure apps I thought would have issues worked flawlessly and faster. This included Wi-Fi Analyzer, TightVNC Server, and even Cisco Packet Tracer:</p>
<p><img src="packettracer.png#center" alt="Cisco Packet Tracer" title="Cisco Packet Tracer"></p>
<p><img src="gen2.png#right" alt="Generation 2 only" title="Generation 2 only"></p>
<p>Hyper-V runs fast, but virtual machines must be Generation 2 (Generation 1 isn&rsquo;t even selectable as an option).</p>
<p>Unlike running apps, Hyper-V won&rsquo;t emulate Intel. Thus, installation ISOs must be for the ARM architecture only. That means you can&rsquo;t install Windows Server in a virtual machine as Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t provide an ARM version of it. However, Windows 11 for ARM works fine. When it comes to Linux, both the Fedora and Ubuntu Linux distributions I installed in Hyper-V wouldn&rsquo;t boot until I reduced the number of virtual processor cores to one. Since most software is multi-threaded, this meant slightly slower performance during the installation and afterwards. Increasing the cores after installation prevented both distributions from booting, so it must be an issue with processor translation within Hyper-V.</p>
<p>Luckily, the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installed perfectly and was lightning fast. So, if you need to run Linux on a Copilot+ PC, I recommend using WSL instead of Hyper-V.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>While the AI features are nice, the biggest benefit Copilot+ PCs provide in my opinion is performance. It still blows my mind how fast apps are on this platform. So, unless you are a gamer, or need to run a lot of Hyper-V virtual machines, ARM-based Copilot+ PCs are the way to go today. And while it&rsquo;s been 7 years since my original prediction, it&rsquo;s refreshing to finally see Windows run so beautifully on ARM.</p>
