    <p><img src="snapdragondevkit.jpg#center" alt="Snapdragon Dev Kit" title="Snapdragon Dev Kit"></p>
<p>A little over a year ago, I got my hands on a Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows powered by Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite CPU, and that inspired me to share <a href="../windows-on-arm/">my first impressions of Windows on ARM</a>. Back then, the platform felt polished but had a few quirks. Now, after a full year of daily use, here’s how it’s held up.</p>
<p>A year ago, I was curious whether this emerging platform could hold up in day-to-day use, particularly in tech-heavy environments like software development and data science &ndash; for example, creating and running AI models. While the platform felt polished, there were some limitations: hardcore gaming required more than the integrated Adreno GPU, nested virtualization in Hyper-V wasn’t supported, and a few apps were unavailable for ARM, requiring emulation.</p>
<p>In that initial post, I also mentioned that native Linux support was just around the corner. I had fully intended to replace Windows 11 entirely with Linux shortly afterward as my daily driver. Fast forward a year, and I’m still using the same device with Windows 11, including the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2), because native Linux support for the platform has been slower to arrive than I expected.</p>
<h1 id="so-how-was-my-experience">So, how was my experience?</h1>
<p>One of the most surprising things about using Windows on ARM for the past year is how uneventful the experience has been &ndash; and I mean that in the best possible way. The system has been stable, reliable, and responsive. Windows updates have rolled out regularly, and I haven’t hit any major compatibility issues in daily use. Everything feels normal, and insanely fast. Even after a year, I’m still amazed by how quick this machine is.</p>
<p>The Windows-on-ARM ecosystem has matured dramatically. Nearly all mainstream apps and development tools now offer native ARM builds, including <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> for running AI models. Even many of the smaller, niche utilities I’ve experimented with this year have been optimized for ARM. While a few holdouts remain, the built-in x86 emulation provided by the Prism component has filled the gaps with near-native performance. For software development, I haven’t faced any compatibility issues, even when working with complex stacks or containerized workflows. The entire experience has been remarkably seamless.</p>
<h1 id="limitations">Limitations?</h1>
<p>Let’s talk about gaming first: simply put, this isn’t a platform designed for gamers. The Adreno GPU in the Snapdragon Elite X wasn’t designed to run modern high-end games. If gaming is a priority, look elsewhere &ndash; this isn&rsquo;t the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>As for nested virtualization, which allows you to run virtual machines (VMs) inside other VMs, it still isn’t supported in Hyper-V. This limitation can be a deal-breaker for certain use cases, especially in environments that rely on complex VM setups, such as our college IT courses.</p>
<p>That being said, one of our IT students recently ran into an interesting challenge. She accidentally purchased a Snapdragon-based Windows laptop without realizing that our program’s minimum hardware requirements specifically call for Intel or AMD CPUs due to the need for nested virtualization in Hyper-V. Normally, that would have prevented her from completing her coursework. However, instead of returning the system right away, she took a creative approach: she used <a href="https://uupdump.net">uupdump.net</a> to build a Windows Server 2025 ISO for ARM and ran it as a native VM on her system (not nested inside Hyper-V). The results were impressive! Performance on the Snapdragon X Elite was excellent, even with minimal RAM allocated to the VM. She successfully completed all her lab work and final project before eventually purchasing an Intel-based PC for the remainder of the program.</p>
<h1 id="whats-next-for-windows-on-arm">What&rsquo;s next for Windows on ARM?</h1>
<p>In the laptop market, the combination of strong performance and long battery life has driven widespread adoption of Windows 11 on ARM devices. Recently, Qualcomm announced the <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/laptops/products/snapdragon-x2-elite">Snapdragon X2 Elite</a>, slated for release in 2026, which pushes the platform even further. The new chip nearly doubles AI processing power and features a significantly upgraded GPU capable of supporting high-end gaming. As for nested virtualization support, that remains uncertain because Qualcomm has yet to comment on it.</p>
<p>After a year of daily use, I can confidently say that Snapdragon-powered Windows on ARM devices are an excellent choice for most users who rely on productivity apps, cloud services, web-based platforms, or even development environments. Performance is outstanding, and the overall ecosystem feels mature and reliable. However, if you’re a gamer or require nested virtualization, it’s worth waiting until next year’s release of the Snapdragon X2 Elite and seeing how it performs in reviews.</p>
