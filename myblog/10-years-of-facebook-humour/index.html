<p>While most of my posts are pictures (funny pictures, persona pictures, memes, etc.), I’ve also got lots of funny text posts.  I got a chuckle out of reading them again, so I thought I’d share them here for others to enjoy!</p>
<p>Here they are, sorted from newest to oldest:</p>
<p>If you want to rapidly get through a crowded area, just carry a clipboard and try to make eye contact with people. People will give you space&hellip;.fast ;-)</p>
<p>Jeff: Our new IT guy moved here from Australia.
Me: Oh, really?
Jeff: Yeah, he comes from a LAN down under.</p>
<p>Went out and picked up some fried chicken. Thought it&rsquo;d be the most appropriate food to eat while watching the US election ;-)</p>
<p>Turned back the regular clocks 1 hour this morning. My two binary clocks? Just had to turn them back a bit ;-)</p>
<p>Cooking a Thanksgiving dinner is more about organizational skills than anything else. I&rsquo;ve optimized the list of tasks and subtasks so that everything is done at exactly the same time with an offset of 15 seconds for each one to allow for easy transfer. This is why you need to have Microsoft Project loaded somewhere in your kitchen people!</p>
<p>Tonight&rsquo;s WWITPRO was pretty neat - it was a sort of like a wine tasting party, but instead of wine, we passed around a ton of laptop models that Dell provided. &ldquo;This one has a nice carbon fibre texture and build quality, and the feint smell of a 6th gen i7&rdquo; ;-)</p>
<p>I asked Siri, “Surely it isn’t going to rain tomorrow?” And she replied, “Yes it will, and don’t call me Shirley.”  Turns out I left Airplane mode on….</p>
<p>I should open a bar that serves nothing but alcoholic apple cider drinks, and has free Wi-Fi. I could call it &ldquo;Ciderspace&rdquo; ;-)</p>
<p>Every time I buy coffee grinds, they always make a big deal about the coffee being &ldquo;ethically sourced&rdquo; - I should open my own coffee company, where all of the coffee is &ldquo;un-ethically sourced&rdquo; - I could call it &ldquo;Bad Ass Coffee&rdquo; and make a fortune :D</p>
<p>Today, I showed someone (not saying who) a job ad for a &ldquo;Senior Mobile Developer&rdquo; position. Their reaction was &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to apply for that job, but I&rsquo;m not a senior.&rdquo; It took them a few seconds after my very obvious WTF expression to see what they misunderstood. I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone turn that many shades of red before :D</p>
<p>OMG&hellip;..I couldn&rsquo;t take a pic of it because I was on the road, but I just saw the same model of car we had growing up pimped out on Hwy 24: a 1984 Plymouth Voyager minivan with a custom &ldquo;fire&rdquo; paintjob, intake vents and slim alloy wheels - and the seats inside were redone with red velvet. I&rsquo;m so glad I wasn&rsquo;t drinking coffee or pop when I saw this or it&rsquo;d be out my nose :D</p>
<p>Deciding on a restaurant to go to for dinner is harder than nailing a jello to a tree&hellip;..suggestions anyone?</p>
<p>Imagine going back in time and describing what a selfie is to someone in the 80s&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The US and Britain are in a competition to see who can mess themselves up the most. Currently Britain is in the lead, but the US has a Trump card up their sleeve&hellip;.;-)</p>
<p>My grass is now 100% yellow and maintenance-free!</p>
<p>Still at Hospital&hellip;. today is not a good day. I decided to go horseback riding - something I haven&rsquo;t done in forever. It turned out to be a big mistake! I got on the horse and started out slow, but then we went a little faster, and before I knew it we were going as fast as the horse could go. I couldn&rsquo;t take the pace and fell off but caught my foot in the stirrup with the horse dragging me. It wouldn&rsquo;t stop - it just kept going around and around in a circle. Thank goodness the store manager at Wal-Mart came out and unplugged the machine.</p>
<p>The quickest way to turn a t-shirt into a fuzzy winter sweater is to wrestle with my dog for 5 minutes&hellip;..</p>
<p>I live right behind a big park with a pro running track. Right now there are probably 50+ high schools competing there today, and their rest/water tents are set up all along the shaded areas amongst the trees right behind my back fence (about 6 feet from my picnic table). And in this heat, everyone looks tired. I just picked up some fresh KFC, and Pepper and I are eating it outside at my picnic table right now&hellip;&hellip;slowly. About 4 tents down, I heard someone say &ldquo;Oh god, is that KFC?!? It&rsquo;s driving me nuts!&rdquo;&hellip;..hahaha :D</p>
<p>It was such a beautiful day out today, I did something I haven&rsquo;t done for years&hellip; I played a round of golf. Sure, it was Wii golf&hellip;&hellip;but still&hellip;..</p>
<p>There was an email I had to respond to that I just couldn&rsquo;t word properly. After having a coffee, I worded it effortlessly and perfectly. Coffee works people!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleasantly surprised that there is a place in Harlem, NYC called &ldquo;Harlem Shake&rdquo; that serves burger and shakes ;-)</p>
<p>The new ordering kiosks at McDonalds are pretty cool. Firstly, they don&rsquo;t mess up your order&hellip;&hellip;secondly, you can totally customize everything - so I investigated, and found that it lets you order up to 10 patties on a Big Mac!</p>
<p>HTTP 200 jokes are OK&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Was digging through the middle compartment in the car and pulled out a zipper case full of music CDs&hellip;&hellip;from way back when we didn&rsquo;t listen to the songs on our phone via Bluetooth in our cars. Popped one in the CD player and listened one heck of an odd assortment of awesome tunes&hellip;&hellip;.it was sort of like &ldquo;car archaeology&rdquo; :D</p>
<p>Am I the only one who thinks Kathleen Wynne looks like Humpty Dumpty from Digital Underground?</p>
<p>Yup&hellip;&hellip;like that great song &ldquo;American Frisbee&rdquo; by Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young ;-)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard so many David Bowie songs on the radio - it&rsquo;s like every radio station is playing them all day long&hellip;&hellip;if Justin Bieber dies, I&rsquo;m not turning on the radio at all.</p>
<p>Whoever put the &ldquo;b&rdquo; in the word &ldquo;subtle&rdquo; was a clever bastard.</p>
<p>I just bought myself a ton of new socks tonight. In retrospect, it&rsquo;s probably the best gift I could give my dog for Christmas ;-)</p>
<p>I just used the phrase &ldquo;Cheer up dude&hellip;.it&rsquo;s Whopper Wednesday!&rdquo;, and it worked as expected ;-)</p>
<p>What happens in Vegas doesn&rsquo;t happen to me&hellip;..</p>
<p>Not to brag, but I can almost always tell if they&rsquo;re using fake dinosaurs in a movie.</p>
<p>I bet the YMCA dance is way harder to do in Japanese&hellip;.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re at an Apple store during a robbery, you&rsquo;re technically an iWitness&hellip;..</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to become incredibly rich once I invent a dog whistle that makes the sound of a cheese wrapper&hellip;..</p>
<p>Walk into A&amp;W for breakfast, immediately get greeted by the Saturday regulars, the cashier already has my order rung in and says &ldquo;You&rsquo;re late this morning.&rdquo; I feel like Norm from &ldquo;Cheers&rdquo; ;-)</p>
<p>There is a point in every man&rsquo;s life where you find yourself standing outside a pizza parlour at 1:00am with 2 other guys unloading 4 arcade machines from a pickup truck ;-)</p>
<p>I thought I understood the I before E grammar rule until eight weird feisty foreign neighbours in beige tried to get me involved in a heist&hellip;..</p>
<p>I wonder if I have a hoarding problem with collecting episodes of that show “Hoarders”?</p>
<p>At the drive thru&hellip;. Cashier: &ldquo;Is it for here or to go?&rdquo; Me: &ldquo;For here - I&rsquo;m just going to eat it in my car in the drive-thru lane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a special place in Hell for people that call you back after you accidentally butt dial them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so lazy with my spelling that I take pride when Google doesn’t even recognize or attempt a guess at what the hell I’m trying to look up.</p>
<p>Feeling bored &amp; wicked? Go to a crowded mall &amp; find a great parking spot. Then just sit in your car with the reverse lights on.</p>
<p>Awesome Sysadmin Day dinner at Chen&rsquo;s with a slew of Linux admins from the KW area&hellip;&hellip;had a great time! Every dinner conversation should include a discussion of awk, KDE and Python ;-)</p>
<p>I saw this advertisement in a window that said: ìTelevision, 1$, volume stuck on full.î I thought to myself, I cant turn that down.?</p>
<p>$5 burrito day people&hellip;&hellip;make sure you stop by Home Depot and pick up a plunger and some air fresheners on the way back&hellip;.;-)</p>
<p>If I owned a Zoup franchise, I&rsquo;d totally recreate the soup Nazi episode from Seinfeld&hellip;..&ldquo;No zoup for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Useless fact of the day &ldquo;In the late 1990s, Microsoft secretly developed it&rsquo;s own distribution of Linux, but shelved it after quality control researchers deemed it &ldquo;too stable&rdquo; ;-)</p>
<p>I no longer refer to it as &ldquo;checking my email&rdquo; at work. I now call it &ldquo;catching up on my soaps&rdquo;&hellip;..</p>
<p>Can you spare just $2.00? Ranji is a 9yr old boy living in Namibia. He has only 1 leg, 1 arm and 1 eye. Each day he has to ride 7 miles to school along a narrow road on a rusty bike with bent wheels, no brakes and only 1 pedal. If you send us just $2, we will send you the video - it&rsquo;s absolutely hilarious.</p>
<p>Never put Mentos in beer!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a joke for all the mind readers out there:</p>
<p>I find it mildly amusing that the phone number for the Apple Store in Waterloo (519-772-5150) contains the model number of the first PC (the IBM 5150) ;-)</p>
<p>Why do Java developers wear glasses? &hellip;.Because they can’t C#</p>
<p>So many of my neighbours barbecued today, and it smelled so good. Next time I pick up KFC or Smokin Tony&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m going to drive real slow around the neighbourhood with my windows down. That&rsquo;s right&hellip;.payback is a bitch&hellip;..</p>
<p>I asked someone about their time in prison. They said &ldquo;I have mixed feelings. On one hand</p>
<p>I was surrounded by the worst society had to offer. I shared cells with thieves, murderers, and rapists. On the other hand the prison library was filled with the best collection of literature that I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I don&rsquo;t know. It has its prose and cons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how vinyl records are making a comeback (albeit with a small group of people). Perhaps in 10 years, CDs will also make a retro comeback&hellip;..after all, they&rsquo;re just small records&hellip;.but read with frickin&rsquo; lasers!</p>
<p>I just finished designing a website for an orphanageÖ There isn&rsquo;t a home page ;-)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always Taco night somewhere&hellip;..</p>
<p>Some people say &ldquo;Home is where you hang your hat&rdquo; while others say &ldquo;Home is where you can dance to the fridge naked while listening to Uptown Funk and playing air keytar&rdquo;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Three things freak me out: 1. Spiders 2. Clowns 3. People who buy software Actually, 2 and 3 are the same&hellip;..</p>
<p>Saturday morning boot procedure: 1. Locate /boot/diner-with-bacon-eggs-and-strong-coffee.bin, 2. Execute in first available memory address space, 3. Start all other processes normally.</p>
<p>Did you hear what the kid with no hands got for his birthday? Neither did we; we&rsquo;re still waiting for him to open it&hellip;</p>
<p>I should open an Irish pub called &ldquo;Bobby McFerrin&rsquo;s&rdquo; - it&rsquo;d be a place where you don&rsquo;t have to worry&hellip;you can just be happy ;-)</p>
<p>So I finish putting groceries in my car and get in, and someone walks behind my car, yells &ldquo;Oh my god!&rdquo; then runs up to my window and asks if he can take a picture of my UNIXGURU license plate for Twitter. Of course I said yes ;-)</p>
<p>Sex, drugs and sausage rolls.</p>
<p>Fifty Shades of Grey is only considered a romantic story because the guy is a billionaire. If he was living in a trailer or shack somewhere in the woods, it would be more like an episode of &ldquo;Criminal Minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Am I the only one who thought that Penn &amp; Teller learned everything they know from RUN DMC?</p>
<p>If Citizen Kane took place in the twenty-first century, Orson Wells would be sighing, Mario instead of Rosebud.</p>
<p>I figure that the Seahawks have a 50/50 chance of winning the Super Bowl on Sunday&hellip;.</p>
<p>Thought I saw a rainbow this morning&hellip;&hellip;but it turned out that they were just filming a Skittles commercial down the road&hellip;.</p>
<p>What do those people who make the emotional music for drama movies do when they retire? They make commercials for Michigan&hellip;.</p>
<p>Patted down my shirt &amp; pants pockets looking for keys. Realized I just performed 2/3 of the Macarena Dance.</p>
<p>If I were an elementary school teacher, I&rsquo;d take the class on a field trip to the Coca-Cola factory&hellip;..and then give them a pop quiz ;-)</p>
<p>If someone takes too long to order at the drive-thru, a trap door should open that drops their car into a pit of fire.</p>
<p>Sir Mix-A-Lot is probably one of the most trustworthy people in the world. He cannot lie &hellip;and he&rsquo;s been knighted!</p>
<p>If a crackhouse is filled with love, it becomes a crackhome&hellip;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse&hellip; I really should have invested in one of those carbon monoxide detectors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had the urge to buy an old briefcase from Value Village, then walk up to a stranger on the street, hand it to them and say, &ldquo;You know what to do.&rdquo; Then quickly disappear from sight&hellip;..</p>
<p>Hipsters can hear a hacky sack like a dog can hear a dog whistle.</p>
<p>I like to wear shorts around the house in the winter. But I ripped my shorts yesterday and had to sew them back up. Yup, that’s right, britches love stitches.</p>
<p>When Hugh Hefner dies no one will say &ldquo;he&rsquo;s in a better place now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I just made my first Christmas purchase of the year two days ago. Let&rsquo;s talk procrastination. Later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now reached the age where just the other day is any time from 3 days to 25 years ago&hellip;..</p>
<p>If Holiday shopping gets you down, just go to Zehrs, buy some fabric softener, and ask the cashier for a gift receipt ;-)</p>
<p>All hugs are good hugs except bear hugs. A bear hug is like a regular hug except you die at the end&hellip;</p>
<p>If you want to have some fun, sit in Starbucks and scream into your phone &ldquo;What we need is fresh screenwriting talent! An unknown! Where on earth can we find it?&rdquo; ;-)</p>
<p>You never really realize how strong you are, until you get a snack stuck in a vending machine&hellip;.</p>

<p>OK - I live in a quiet neighbourhood with lots of old people. So naturally, a lot of bible thumpers come around to the doors. And my &ldquo;No Soliciting&rdquo; sign on my side door window doesn&rsquo;t seem to deter them. So, I put one of these &ldquo;I stand with Israel&rdquo; signs in my side door window&hellip;..now I watch them walk up to my door, and then double back as if my house was an Ebola quarantine&hellip;&hellip;that&rsquo;s one way of turning an ultra-annoying situation into a humorous giggle ;-)</p>

As we got closer, I noticed that not one of the owners appeared to be less than 60 years old ;-)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m somewhat surprised that no one in Kitchener has opened a pub with the name/slogan: &ldquo;Wunderbar: Where Oktoberfest happens all year round!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After several days of failed attempts and modifications and tweaks, I just finished successfully compiling all of the libraries, components and binaries needed for the latest version of Firefox on IRIX 6.5 on my SGI Fuel. And it&rsquo;s running fast and stable!</p>
<p>Judging by my powers, I think I may have been bitten by a radioactive sloth.</p>

<p>I just heard the best description of what it&rsquo;s like to ride a public bus: it&rsquo;s like a mental institution on wheels&hellip;..</p>
<p>I almost picked up another arcade machine tonight. I think I may be addicted to arcade games&hellip;&hellip;may have to join AA (Arcades Anonymous).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind being &ldquo;left to my own devices&rdquo;&hellip;as long as I have a charger and an outlet.</p>
<p>OK - apparently, it&rsquo;s also considered rude to say &ldquo;Nice phone!&rdquo; when someone shows you a picture of their baby on their Galaxy S5. What is it with Mondays?!? People&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The 4 food groups for most programmers: fast, frozen, microwaved, and junk.</p>
<p>I think I should invent a new high definition video standard that gives high pixel density along a whole wall. Great for people with no attention span that want to watch several shows simultaneously. I think I&rsquo;ll call it 80HD.</p>
<p>I bet if I had an orange vest and a traffic cone I could just dig wherever I wanted without being questioned.</p>
<p>While in line at A&amp;W, I end up listening in on this conversation at the table behind me: &ldquo;I am totally going to ace this interview. I wore my lucky sweatpants!&rdquo; Yeah&hellip;..you go girl&hellip;.</p>

<p>Well, I just had my first sighting of Halloween decorations at the mall. And with Halloween approaching, I&rsquo;m curious what slutty nurses will dress up as this year&hellip;..</p>

<p>Yes, alcohol causes a number of deaths; but it also causes a number of births.</p>
<p>I want to get a white jumpsuit and a giant butterfly net and chase random people around yelling ìYou must return to the Institute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The main reason I would never buy a VW bug is that I would feel guilty knowing that whenever I drove by a vehicle with kids in it, someone was getting slugged.</p>

<p>Walking Pepper in the park, we overheard a young couple sitting on the bench by the splash pad as we walked by: Guy: &ldquo;You know, swearing is not attractive.&rdquo; Girl: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not attractive anyways, so fuck off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did you know that there is a name for the cheesy small bits at the bottom of a bag of SmartFood? They are called &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; ;-)</p>

<p>People who squirt ketchup all over their fries instead of dipping them in it are not the kind of people you need in your life&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The answer is grilled cheese on sourdough rye bread with chipotle dip on the side. The question doesn&rsquo;t matter&hellip;.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in line at Starbucks to get my Rob Ford special and the naive idealists behind me talking about Gaza decide that they&rsquo;d like to involve me in their rant. So I politely declined. The one lady then said &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you interested in world problems?&rdquo;, to which I replied &ldquo;Whenever I think of Gaza, I immediately think of all the smug bastards in coffee shops who have a simple solution to all of the world&rsquo;s problems, and then I think&hellip;..gee&hellip;.do I want to be part of that? No.&rdquo; The rest of my waiting in line was very peaceful after that :-)</p>

<p>Went to the McDonald&rsquo;s drive through with Pepper in the back seat and ordered 20 chicken nuggets for later. Then I pulled into the Esso next to it to get gas. While I was pumping the gas, the damn dog managed to get the bag open, get the box open, and eat 18 of the nuggets&hellip;&hellip;all very quietly without me noticing. And when I got into the car, the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; look told me what happened&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

<p>Normally I don&rsquo;t pick up the phone for unknown numbers, but I did a few minutes ago and it happened to be a Liberal Party propaganda person who sounded incredibly tired. After they did their spiel, I told him my voting strategy: to vote for the least ugly person. My reasoning is simple - all candidates will likely do an equally crappy job, so why not at least have a good looking government? I&rsquo;m not sure it was because he was tired, but after a short pause, he said enthusiastically &ldquo;You know - that&rsquo;s a pretty good strategy&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Had to spend the afternoon with a new instructor - in casual chit-chat, I mentioned that I have a Star Wars toaster that burns the image of Darth Vader into the toast. He said &ldquo;Really? Why?&rdquo; I thought it was obvious&hellip;..I prefer my toast a little on the dark side.</p>
<p>I know you have been laying awake at night wondering why baby diapers have brand names such as Luvs, Huggies, and Pampers, while undergarments for old people are called Depends. Well here is the low down on the whole thing. When babies crap in their pants, people are still gonna Luv’em, Hug’em and Pamper’em. When old people crap in their pants, it Depends on who ís in the will.</p>

<p>As part of casual chit-chat this morning, someone asked me how it was working at the UW School of Accounting (I was a programmer there back in the 90s). I immediately had a flash back of me pretending my staple remover was Pac-man for 6 hours&hellip;..good times.</p>

<p>2014 is going to be a great year! I resolve to: 1) Figure out what last year&rsquo;s New Year resolutions were. 2) Start doing them. 3) If 1) fails, or 2) seems too hard, I will take 2014 to focus on creating some resolutions for 2015.</p>

<li>Get some fresh decaf espresso</li>
<li>Brew it in a bodum for about 5 minutes</li>
<li>Add a small amount of unsweetened low-fat Almond milk (instead of cream)</li>

<p>From Jeff Smith: A young man with his pants hanging half off his ass, two gold front teeth, and a half inch thick gold chain around his neck; walked into the local welfare office to pick up his check. He marched up to the counter and said, &ldquo;Hi. You know, I just H A T E drawing welfare. I&rsquo;d really rather have a job.. I don&rsquo;t like taking advantage of the system, getting something for nothing.&rdquo; The social worker behind the counter said &ldquo;Your timing is excellent. We Just got a job opening from a very wealthy old man who wants a chauffeur and bodyguard for his beautiful daughter. You&rsquo;ll have to drive around in his 2012 Mercedes-Benz CL, and he will supply all of your clothes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Because of The long hours, meals will be provided. You&rsquo;ll also be expected to escort the daughter on her overseas holiday trips. This is rather awkward to say But you will also have, as part of your job, the assignment to satisfy her sexual urges as the daughter is in her mid-20&rsquo;s and has a rather strong sex drive.&rdquo; The guy, just plain wide-eyed, said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re bullshittin&rsquo; me!&rdquo; The social worker said, &ldquo;Well &hellip;.yeah, &hellip;. but you started it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From Doug Weatherby: The Big Bang Starts the Universe Out in the Most Metal Way Possible ~14 billion years ago Once upon a time, our universe was condensed into a point smaller than a single atom, which sounds super cute but actually was quite volatile. It suddenly burst, giving birth to both time and space. After just 100 seconds, it was trillions of miles across. Innumerable elementary subatomic particles were crashing into one another, with antimatter destroying matter. Hydrogen gas formed, and collapsed by gravity into itself until pressure grew so immense that those hydrogen atoms fused into helium. So stars were born, fusing atoms into ever more complex elements until the stars began creating iron, at which point they collapsed into themselves and exploded into supernovas ñ unimaginably powerful detonations that in an instant formed all of the other elements that make up our world. So every atom in your body was born in a star. You are, technically, a star. Except you, Miley Cyrus.</p>

<p>Ever walk into a room with some purpose in mind, only to completely forget what that purpose was? Turns out, doors themselves are to blame for these strange memory lapses. Psychologists at the University of Notre Dame have discovered that passing through a doorway triggers what&rsquo;s known as an event boundary in the mind, separating one set of thoughts and memories from the next. Your brain files away the thoughts you had in the previous room and prepares a blank slate for the new locale. It&rsquo;s not aging, it&rsquo;s the door! Thank goodness for studies like this. Actually, that&rsquo;s all bullshit. You probably have Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>When Oedipus reached Thebes, he encountered a Sphinx. &ldquo;If you want to pass this point alive, you must answer my riddle: What goes on four legs in the morning, on two legs at noon, and on three legs in the evening?&rdquo;, the Sphinx asked. Oedipus pondered for a moment. &ldquo;Probably one of those new Pokemon&rdquo; he finally replied. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s like 600 of them, and I&rsquo;d be surprised if one of them doesn&rsquo;t change its number of legs whilst evolving.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; spoke the Sphinx. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t reasonably expect you to remember all of their names. You may pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Courtesy Jeff Smith: Bob was sitting on the plane when a guy took the seat beside him. The guy was an emotional wreck, pale, hands shaking, moaning in fear. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Bob asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been transferred to Detroit , there are crazy people there. They&rsquo;ve got lots of shootings, gangs, race riots, drugs, poor public schools, and the highest crime rate in the nation.&rdquo; Jack replied, &ldquo;Nonsense! I&rsquo;ve lived in Detroit all my life. It&rsquo;s not as bad as the media says. Find a nice home, go to work, mind your own business, and enrol your kids in a nice private school. It&rsquo;s as safe a place as anywhere in the world.&rdquo; The guy relaxed and stopped shaking and said, &ldquo;Oh, thank you. I&rsquo;ve been worried to death. But if you live there and say it&rsquo;s OK, I&rsquo;ll take your word for it. What do you do for a living?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the tail gunner on a Budweiser truck.&rdquo;</p>

I&rsquo;ve held off on getting Mists of Pandaria because I got burned out on endgame progression after Wrath of the Lich King and the Cataclysm content is still new to me. Plus monks seem redundant in an era of dual specialization and viable hybrid DPS, and while I know they&rsquo;re well-established in the lore, Pandaren don&rsquo;t appeal to me.

<p>Some good points in this article that illustrate the (somewhat natural) move to a consumer-focus in how we interact with smartphone technologies today - companies are also adopting the consumer focus and social networking features in their own corporate smartphones to drive productivity. This is what Apple iOS, Google Android, and Windows Phone 7 have excelled at and what RIM lacks from a &ldquo;let&rsquo;s stand back and look at our strategy&rdquo; perspective.</p>
<p>Some lady followed us home yesterday after seeing my UNIXGURU license plate - she wanted to know if I knew anyone who could do HTML5/LAMP development. Cool, but sort of creepy at the same time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to switch to Google+, but 95% of everyone I know is still on Facebook&hellip;&hellip;it&rsquo;s like going to some obscure coffee shop where one of your friends hangs out compared to Starbucks, where the rest of your friends hang out.</p>
<p>Just finished my Playbook app &ldquo;Reverse Zombify&rdquo; after almost an entire night of polishing. It still isn&rsquo;t perfect, but there is a point where you have to say &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good enough&rdquo; and just finish it. Anyone with a Playbook who wants to sideload it and try it out, let me know.</p>
<p>I honestly can&rsquo;t believe how lame this is, but it is true - I threw my back out tonight playing Angry Birds.</p>
<p>Just putting the finishing touches this week on my Playbook app for the BlackBerry Partner&rsquo;s Fund Challenge - it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Reverse Zombify&rdquo; - you actually have to turn people into zombies in strategic ways to earn points. And if you get all of the Village People, you earn 1000 bonus points. If you get all the members of the A Team, you get 5000 bonus points.</p>

<p>Creating course materials is such a boring job - it is basically transporting large amounts of caffeine from the coffee maker to the toilette. At least I&rsquo;m good at it.</p>
<p>While standing in line at Tim Hortons, I really don&rsquo;t think it is offensive to let the person in front of you know that they typed &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; wrong on their BlackBerry. Apparently, others disagree.</p>
<p>Another social networking event tonight&hellip;&hellip;ahhhhh! I&rsquo;m really starting to hate smiling and making polite chit-chat&hellip;..it just isn&rsquo;t me.</p>
<p>Starting to come down off of the Red Bull high from the last 2 days. I don&rsquo;t remember how many I drank, but it was a lot. I don&rsquo;t think I could have stayed awake during The Great Canadian Appathon without it though&hellip;.</p>
<p>My new years resolution is to have more patience for people who call flash/disk storage &ldquo;memory&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can have a lot of fun today because the malls are so crowded - just go to the mall, but not to shop.</p>
<p>I just realized something - that new BlackBerry Playbook RIM is coming out with basically runs the same OS that those old ICON computers did back in high school (QNX) - I have good memories of getting banned from the ICON lab at GCI for breaking into the LexICON file server&hellip;&hellip;.about 4 times I think&hellip;..</p>
<p>I am giving two presentations at this year&rsquo;s Microsoft Virtual Summit&hellip;&hellip;.and I&rsquo;ve spent all day trying to come up with content for it&hellip;&hellip;.ended up with nothing&hellip;&hellip;I think my brain had a &ldquo;blue screen of death&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have now officially found my Starbucks limit - 7 Venti Bolds per day. It was really freakin&rsquo; hard to type this.</p>
<p>A girlfriend is no substitute for video games&hellip;.</p>
<p>I just perfected the art of snowblowing. Only took 7 years.</p>
<p>I realized today that the reason why I order out when I have friends over (like tonight and the last dozen times) is because I don&rsquo;t cook (out of common courtesy for others).</p>
