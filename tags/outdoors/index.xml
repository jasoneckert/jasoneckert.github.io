      <description>At the end of each year, I take some time to reflect on the previous year - it provides perspective, and is a lot of fun!
For me, 2018 was the year I spent a lot of time improving myself physically, challenging myself mentally, and most importantly, enjoying life!
On the personal side, I cut out the bad foods from my diet:
 breads starches alcohol  On top of this, I upped my indoor and outdoor exercise to lose a whopping 85 pounds since mid 2017 - I feel great, have loads of energy, and no longer have any back pain whatsoever!</description>

      <description>Yup - it’s vacation time again! And this next week I plan to do nothing but relax, get a tan, drink “Muskoka Dry Pale Ginger Ale” and read a few books that I haven’t had the time to open yet. And yes, my daughter is going to swim all week long - that is her in the water with the kids from the cottage next door.
Now you are probably wondering why I am blogging on my vacation&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;shouldn’t a vacation be devoid of TV/phones/Internet/computers?</description>

      <description>We just got back from vacation this week! No computers, no telephones, no IM, no text messages, no stress (just the occasional deer, moose or bear). Several years ago, I didn’t take any vacation at all during the year and promptly vowed never to do that again. In just one week of vacation, you can reduce all of the stress that you worked so hard to build up all year long.</description>
