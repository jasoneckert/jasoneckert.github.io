      <title>The Story Behind the Mac vs PC Rivalry — And Where Linux Quietly Took Over</title>
      <link>https://jasoneckert.github.io/myblog/mac-vs-pc/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;mac-vs-pc.jpg#center&#34; alt=&#34;Mac vs PC&#34; title=&#34;Mac vs PC&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to computers, most people today use either a Mac or a PC. In this post, I’ll explore how this digital rivalry began, how it shaped modern computing — and how Linux quietly carved out a space of its own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-early-days-roots-of-the-rivalry&#34;&gt;The Early Days: Roots of the Rivalry&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, personal computers (PCs) began appearing in homes, schools, and businesses across the world. A wide range of companies entered the market, including Apple, IBM, Tandy, Commodore, Atari, Texas Instruments, and Sinclair. Most of these early machines featured basic text-based interfaces — often just a simple version of the BASIC programming language. But a few notable outliers, like the Apple Macintosh and the IBM PC, ran more sophisticated operating systems that hinted at what modern computing would eventually become.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Configuring GitHub Discussions to provide Blog Comments</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;comments.png#center&#34; alt=&#34;Comments button&#34; title=&#34;Comments button&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons why I&amp;rsquo;ve avoided adding a comment section to my blog these past two decades. Firstly, it can promote inappropriate and low effort responses&amp;hellip; especially if comments can be made anonymously. As a result, my home page encourages readers to email me directly. I&amp;rsquo;ve received well over a thousand emails from readers over the years, and I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed replying to each one. Secondly, introducing a comment section requires the execution of dynamic content that usually stores comments within a database. I instead prefer to use a simple, static website for my personal blog that can be easily hosted anywhere I choose. This also means I don&amp;rsquo;t have to configure and maintain databases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It can be used to perform a wide variety of very different tasks, such as running graphical apps, streaming media, performing home automation, and monitoring humidity levels in a greenhouse. This is largely made possible by the Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s many interfaces (including GPIO, USB, HDMI, and wired/wireless Ethernet), as well as its ability to run the highly-customizable Linux operating system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Linux Distro Hopping is a Bad Idea</title>

After all, there are hundreds of different distros available - and because each one is often geared to provide the optimal experience for a specific user or use-case (e.g., gaming), it&amp;rsquo;s become commonplace to assume that there must be a specific Linux distro out there that will suit your individual needs. Consequently, most Linux users believe that you should choose a Linux distro using the same process as choosing a wardrobe or eyewear frames. And that means trying on many different Linux distros to see how they look ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Running a Mainstream Linux Distro Natively on Apple Silicon: Fedora Asahi Remix First Impressions</title>
      <link>https://jasoneckert.github.io/myblog/fedora-asahi-remix/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://jasoneckert.github.io/myblog/fedora-asahi-remix/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a year and a half since the &lt;a href=&#34;https://asahilinux.org/&#34;&gt;Asahi Linux&lt;/a&gt; project allowed us to run Arch Linux natively on our Apple Silicon computers. And while my overall experience has been excellent, the Asahi Linux project is switching their flagship Linux distribution (distro) &lt;a href=&#34;https://asahilinux.org/2023/08/fedora-asahi-remix/&#34;&gt;from Arch to Fedora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why the switch from Arch to Fedora? You could argue that Fedora is a much more popular mainstream distribution compared to Arch, or that Linus Torvalds himself uses Fedora already on his Apple Silicon-based Macbook using the Asahi boot components and drivers. But the main reason is that there have been many &lt;a href=&#34;https://social.treehouse.systems/@marcan/109971521711413167&#34;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; surrounding the maintenance of ARM packages for Arch Linux, and that the Fedora team is both capable and willing to provide provide the support needed to provide a truly polished Linux experience on modern Macs (the main goal of the Asahi Linux project). By moving to Fedora, the Asahi team can focus on reverse engineering Apple hardware while the Fedora team can focus on maintaining the distribution itself on the Apple Silicon platform. This combination of Fedora with the Asahi boot components and drivers for Apple Silicon is called &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fedora Asahi Remix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After all, Linux has evolved to be one of the most foundational topics in tech education. Information Technology (IT) fields such as server/network administration, cloud administration, cybersecurity, and software development now require a solid grasp of the Linux operating system.&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;sixthedition.jpg#right&#34; alt=&#34;CompTIA Linux+ and LPIC-1 Guide to Linux Certification, Sixth Edition&#34; title=&#34;CompTIA Linux+ and LPIC-1 Guide to Linux Certification, Sixth Edition&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But I had a wife and child and needed to think more responsibly. So, as my spring university semester was ending, I applied for an instructor job that my grandmother saw in a newspaper ad and thought I&amp;rsquo;d be perfect for. After an interview and demo teach, I got the job and started the following Monday&amp;hellip; April 20, 1998.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-all-started-this-month-last-year&#34;&gt;It all started this month last year&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In March 2022, the alpha release for Asahi was made available and I immediately installed it on a Mac Mini with an 8-core Apple Silicon (ARM64) M1 processor. Asahi is a Linux distribution that can run natively on Apple Silicon-based Macs due to some slick reverse engineering provided by members of the open source community. Moreover, running Asahi is perfectly legal because Apple formally allows booting non-macOS operating systems on their Apple Silicon platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Regardless of how much you&amp;rsquo;ve used Linux in the past, there&amp;rsquo;s likely a few or more that you probably didn&amp;rsquo;t know. Try answering each one from memory (or give it a good guess!) and then expand the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show me the answer!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; section to see if you are correct. PERFECT SCORES WIN A PRIZE!!! If you knew the correct answer to all 26 of these questions off the top of your head, send me an email and I&amp;rsquo;ll send you a link to download a free (yes FREE!) copy of Fedora Linux ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is essentially a blanket term that refers to any software that makes its source code available to others. To be open source, the software project must be released under an open source license, of which there are two main categories: Copyleft and Permissive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Technology certification has been the most common skills benchmark used for hiring and promotion in the IT industry since the early 1990s, with Linux certification being one of the most sought-after. After all, knowing how to use, configure and administer the Linux operating system is prerequisite for a wide variety of different IT job roles, including server administrators, cloud administrators, devops engineers, site reliability engineers, cybersecurity analysts, penetration testers, and software developers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But as strange and complex as they may sound (even to seasoned developers and system administrators), they are not difficult to understand. In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk through the different components and features of the cloud, explaining the associated buzz words along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-the-cloud&#34;&gt;What is the cloud?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back in the early 1990s, when the US government sold off parts of their ARPAnet and NSFnet to private companies (later called Internet Service Providers, or ISPs) to create the public Internet, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything exciting about the Internet at all. After all, the Internet was just a physical computer network that allowed your computer to talk to other computers, usually through a telephone network via a modem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is because reusable software code released under an &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;open source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; license (permitting its reuse) is the norm for nearly all software development today. After all, if we couldn&amp;rsquo;t reuse existing code in new software projects, it would take far longer to bring technologies to market, and the overall software industry wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to evolve as quickly. Moreover, there are two major types of open source licenses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nearly all network hardware, security appliances, smart appliances, cars, wearables and IoT devices also run UNIX or Linux, as do our smartphones and tablets. Want to secure your systems or network, or test your security using ethical hacking? You&amp;rsquo;ll need UNIX or Linux to do that as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Of course, not every little detail is in there. Just those that are actually important (in my expert opinion, of course ;-) Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past few decades, people of all ages across North America have become technology-literate in some way or another. Many of them weren&amp;rsquo;t introduced to technology via desktop or laptop computers, but instead through a smartphone or tablet. Similarly, many desktop and laptop users have switched to using their smartphone or tablet over the past decade to interact with the online world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After all, smartphones and tablets are incredibly easy to use. You open an app to do what you want (social media, shopping, taking pics of food, etc.), and the rest can be done in a Web browser. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter where your files are stored locally because they&amp;rsquo;re easily searchable, and they&amp;rsquo;re automatically synced to the cloud so that you don&amp;rsquo;t lose them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This, in turn allows other software developers worldwide to quickly identify and fix bugs and security loopholes, as well as make feature improvements to the software. Consequently, Open Source software evolves more rapidly than other (&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closed Source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) software, and is considered the gold standard for software today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;oss.png#center&#34; alt=&#34;Open Source Software&#34; title=&#34;Open Source Software&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;open source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has become a household term in software circles.  Most people who work with technology in some capacity know that the Linux operating system is open source, as is the Firefox Web browser and much of the software that runs on their Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to defining open source, most people I’ve talked to aren’t that clear on what it is and how it works, but can often list these three aspects:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Software released under the GPL is commonly called open source software today, and there are dozens of open source licenses available in addition to the GPL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rover.png#center&#34; alt=&#34;MARS Rover&#34; title=&#34;MARS Rover&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two decades ago, a piece of open source software I wrote for a Canadian HPC project caught the attention of someone working for NASA JPL, and after a few emails and a call regarding our experience applying it, a modified version of it was used in a small way to help the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission involving the rovers Spirit and Opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With last week’s announcement that the MER mission is officially over, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to know that a piece of software I wrote helped, even if it was in a small way - it made me smile over coffee that morning, and it’s made me smile several times since then!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The future of smartphones</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;sp1.png#center&#34; alt=&#34;SP1&#34; title=&#34;SP1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the picture at the top of this post, last week BlackBerry’s smartphone market share fell to 0% in the global marketplace. In all fairness, this number reflects the number of devices running BlackBerry OS (not the number of BlackBerry-branded Android devices, which together with all other Android devices, comprise 82% of the market).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you think back to 2007, BlackBerry pretty much owned the smartphone world that they created - they were too big to fail, and too proud to accept that Apple and Google could eat their cake.  But 10 years later, they’re a niche company trying to peddle their security and smartphone management software to any Fortune 500 company that still has fond memories of their brand.  It’s a stark reminder of how quickly the tech industry can change, and how unforgiving it can be to those left behind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This has&#xA;been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I&amp;#39;d like&#xA;any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix; as my OS&#xA;resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system&#xA;due to practical reasons)among other things.&#xA;&#xA;I&amp;#39;ve currently ported bash (1.08) an gcc (1.40), and things seem to work.&#xA;This implies that i&amp;#39;ll get something practical within a few months, and I&amp;#39;d&#xA;like to know what features most people want. Any suggestions are welcome,&#xA;but I won&amp;#39;t promise I&amp;#39;ll implement them :-)&#xA;&#xA;Linus Torvalds torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;so-what-is-linux&#34;&gt;So what is Linux?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Linux is a free and open source operating system that runs on millions of computers and devices today. But in order to understand what that means, let’s start by looking at how Linux came to be&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For those who do not know Scott, he is a VMWare guru (you can join his Southwestern Ontario VMWare user’s group @ &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vmware.com&#34;&gt;www.vmware.com&lt;/a&gt;), as well as a master in the 8th layer of the OSI Model (the political layer).  Although he won’t admit it, he knows UNIX very well and is an advocate of the Open Source movement even though he works mainly with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Free Software does not mean “at no monetary cost”&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..it means that the source code is free to anyone who wants to use it (source code freedom).  In the words of Stallman, think “free” as in “freedom”, not “free” as in “free beer”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rmstalk.png#center&#34; alt=&#34;Richard Stallman talk&#34; title=&#34;Richard Stallman talk&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On July 6th, Richard Stallman gave a talk at the University of Waterloo regarding copyright and its evils.  Although slow at the beginning (perhaps because Richard was still finishing his Pepsi and introducing the features of copyright), it turned out to be a powerful and enlightening educational experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I decided not to write a blog about it until I was able to view it again on video after my vacation and make specific notes.  You can download the whole presentation from the University of Waterloo Computer Science Club @ &lt;a href=&#34;http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca&#34;&gt;http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca&lt;/a&gt; in OGG format.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
