      <title>Demonstrating the Power of Apple Silicon using Actuated CI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;mac_studio.jpg#center&#34; alt=&#34;Mac Studio&#34; title=&#34;Mac Studio&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you may have read in my previous blog posts, my main developer workstation is an Apple Mac Studio with an Apple Silicon M1 Max CPU. But instead of running macOS on it, I run Linux – specifically Fedora Asahi Remix, which is Fedora Linux for ARM + the native Apple hardware support provided by the Asahi Linux project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I prefer Linux to other operating systems, the main reason I do this is for speed – running Linux natively on my Mac Studio is at least twice as fast for every task compared to running macOS natively on it. Linux is simply faster and more optimized, and it can fully harness the power of the M1 Max.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Janet Jackson&#39;s Denial of Service (DoS) Attack</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Janet Jackson might not be the first person who comes to mind when you think of a hacker. But she inadvertently created a malicious payload that performed a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Denial of Service (DoS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; attack on many different hard drive models manufactured in 2005 and later that rotated at a speed of 5400 rpm (rotations per minute).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-did-it-work&#34;&gt;How did it work?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your computer had a 5400 rpm hard drive, all you had to do was play Janet Jackson&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAwaNWGLM0c&#34;&gt;Rhythm Nation music video&lt;/a&gt; and it would unleash an acoustic resonance attack that damaged the hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How an Ancient PowerBook Captured a Summer Vacation</title>

Just like that, I was back in 2006, reliving a summer vacation with my daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s strange how a piece of outdated hardware can tie itself to a moment in time. Here&amp;rsquo;s the story behind it.&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;dwight-bay.jpg#right&#34; alt=&#34;Dwight Bay&#34; title=&#34;Dwight Bay&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>RISCy business: The long and convoluted rise of today&#39;s dominant computing platform</title>

To ensure that a software program could be written easily and with fewer instructions, additional circuitry was added to the central processing unit (CPU) to compensate. This was referred to as complex instruction set computing (CISC). CISC architecture is still common today thanks to the x86 architecture used by Intel and AMD CPUs in most workstations and servers. Unfortunately, the added circuitry within CISC CPUs equated to added cost and complexity - both of which made it more expensive to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ontario&#39;s Computer Part 2: The LEXICON Server</title>

After all, the QNX operating system and programs that ran memory-resident on each ICON had to first be downloaded from the LEXICON across an ARCNET network. Moreover, when users logged into QNX on their ICON, they were actually logging in as a user account on the LEXICON and accessing the files within their home directory on the LEXICON&amp;rsquo;s hard drive. When users printed documents, they printed to the shared printer connected to the LEXICON.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was designed by CEMCorp (Canadian Educational Microprocessor Corporation) and manufactured by Burroughs (later renamed to Unisys). Moreover, it ran the QNX UNIX-like operating system, which was also developed in Canada by two University of Waterloo students.&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;ICON.jpg#right&#34; alt=&#34;ICON&#34; title=&#34;ICON&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you took a computer programming course in high school during the 1980s or early 1990s, you likely remember learning C, BASIC or Pascal on the ICON, as well as many UNIX commands that would pay off later in college or university. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t, you probably remember the ICON as a cool looking steel monstrosity that had an indestructible keyboard and trackball (that everyone tried to spin as fast as they could).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You can read my blog post on it here: &lt;a href=&#34;../../myblog/sparcbook3000st-the-coolest-90s-laptop/&#34; title=&#34;SPARCbook 3000ST: The coolest 90s laptop&#34;&gt;SPARCbook 3000ST: The coolest 90s laptop&lt;/a&gt;. It occasionally shows up on Hacker News, and I get plenty of comments whenever I post it on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The old Web was fun</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was around during the birth of the web in the early 1990s and have enjoyed every twist and turn since then. Even before creating my own personal website and blog (this site) in 1998, I maintained the Department of Science website at UW (originally &lt;a href=&#34;http://sciborg.uwaterloo.ca&#34;&gt;http://sciborg.uwaterloo.ca&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And while I’ve enjoyed watching the evolution of the web, I still think the old web was more fun. In this blog post, I’ll tell you why. But first, let’s cover some background info!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I can’t think of many years in the past decade that had the same amount of academic, physical, and personal fulfillment all in one year!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the academic side, I presented a 12-week Linux+ webinar series at night to IT instructors worldwide for the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA)  Instructor Network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, fit well since I just finished writing the 5th edition of my Linux textbook for Cengage (Linux+ &amp;amp; LPIC Guide to Linux Certification).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But for many of us in the tech industry, these ancient machines are a way to peer into the early days of an industry that has twisted and evolved in leaps and bounds, leaving nearly every player that shaped its landscape forgotten in time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The machine sitting in my driveway at the top of this post is a workstation from the early 1980s with a NS32016 CPU (the first 32-bit general purpose microprocessor) and a whopping 1MB of RAM. It&amp;rsquo;s running Genix (BSD UNIX for the NS32016) and performs at a speed of 2.5 MIPS. For comparison, a modern AMD Ryzen 7 system performs at over 300,000 MIPS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Halt and Catch Fire is the best drama I’ve ever seen - an emotional rollercoaster like no other.  The characters are unforgettable, the acting is nothing short of phenomenal, and the entire series has an incredible message about technology and human progress that you only get once you see the final episode!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It’s a great way to reflect on the events that have happened during the year, and to honest, is actually a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;2016b.jpg#right&#34; alt=&#34;2016b&#34; title=&#34;2016b&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just a quick disclaimer: I have no intention of talking about the shallow-but-popular celebrity death fixation that has taken over the Internet (must be a millennial thing).  That being said, when I heard that Prince died, it led me to watch Purple Rain again (great movie), so there’s a plus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Woz) speak.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, he’s the co-founder of Apple, and the engineer who created the Apple I and Apple II computers.  The Apple II was the first successful, mass-produced personal computer, and as the Woz points out, the “first one that could play arcade games in full colour” (I still have an Apple II that I use to play arcade games like Donkey Kong).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, it wasn’t until August 23, 1991 that it was made publicly accessible for the world to see.  You could argue that August 6 is the real birth of the World Wide Web, but most websites and news aggregators acknowledge August 23 as the true birth of the World Wide Web, including Facebook, which included it as a news item today for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(pun intended)&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NeXT was the computer company that Steve Jobs (co-founder of Apple) created after he got kicked out of Apple in the 1980s.  They made high-end UNIX workstations that were intended to rival Apple computers, and primarily targeted for the higher education and science/engineering markets.  However, they were not as successful as their competitors in this market and when Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he ensured that Apple purchased NeXT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a yearly gathering of Commodorks who create new software and hardware for vintage Commodore computers. I had no idea that it even existed until someone I knew told me about it. Since it’s relatively close to me, I just had to go. Plus, I have many Commodore computers in my vintage computer collection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well, it is a RISC CPU design from a company in England called INMOS that was designed so that it could interface with other CPUs of the same type in a massively parallel fashion (like a mini supercomputer).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;transputer2.jpg#left&#34; alt=&#34;Transputer CPU&#34; title=&#34;Transputer CPU&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason it was made was because CISC CPU designs of the 1980s were getting too bulky and people thought that it would be hard to advance them (of course they were wrong - never doubt engineers!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And DEC was good - they would make computers that would perform much better and cost significantly less than the IBM equivalent (IBM mainframes back then were expensive behemoths).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The DEC PDP (Programmed Data Processor) line of minicomputers were so good and inexpensive, you’d be hard pressed to NOT find one in your local university. The PDP-7 was the first computer to run the infamous UNIX operating system. The PDP-10 was the first computer to introduce time sharing and TCP/IP implementation for the Internet (there were plenty of PDP-10 nodes on the early Internet, or ARPANET). The PDP-11 was the most influential and mass-produced minicomputer of its time that led to the creation of the C programming language as well as the designs of CP/M, DOS, and the Motorola 68000 architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And the home gaming console that led to the most development in this area was the least technologically advanced one for its time:  The 1977 Atari Video Computer System (VCS), later known as the Atari 2600.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Every millennium has a doomsday cult. Every legend gets the distortion knob wound up until the speaker melts. Archeologists at the University of Helsinki today uncovered what could be the earliest known writings from the Cult of Tux, a fanatical religious sect that flourished during the early Silicon Age, just before the dawn of the third millennium AD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning Turing created the Machine. And the Machine was crufty and bodacious, existing in theory only. And von Neumann looked upon the Machine, and saw that it was crufty. He divided the Machine into two Abstractions, the Data and the Code, and yet the two were one Architecture. This is a great Mystery, and the beginning of wisdom. And von Neumann spoke unto the Architecture, and blessed it, saying, &amp;ldquo;Go forth and replicate, freely exchanging data and code, and bring forth all manner of devices unto the earth.&amp;rdquo; And it was so, and it was cool. The Architecture prospered and was implemented in hardware and software. And it brought forth many Systems unto the earth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The first Web browser was made my Tim Berners-Lee on one of these NeXT computers!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was an undergrad student at the University of Waterloo, we had a few NeXT computers (literally two of them I believe) and a bunch of HP PA-RISC 712s running NeXTSTEP for object-oriented software development (it was more common to see Sun or SGI UNIX systems at the university back them).They were cool - and I remember using the HP PA-RISC 712s to do development in university thinking something along the lines of “this is nice, but not as nice as SGI IRIX (Silicon Graphics UNIX).”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The reason that this model (SX835 with Gold top) is one of my favourites in not because it looks good, but rather that it was one of the Pentium models that had the famous FDIV bug.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The FDIV bug was a problem with the floating point unit in early Pentium CPUs that resulted in reduced precision of division operations (FDIV is the x86 assembly language instruction for floating point  division).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Anatomy of an AS/400</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/myblog/anatomy-of-an-as400/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my spring cleaning, I ended up getting rid of my AS/400 model 9404-D10 from 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the power supply is dead in it, I decided to disassemble and photograph the inside of this amazing machine.  AS/400s are well known for their legendary uptimes, and were the “jewel” of IBM in the late 1980s to 1990s.  In 1993, when IBM was close to splitting up their divisions into smaller companies, Bill Gates said that “the only part of IBM that Microsoft would be interested in was the AS/400 division.”  At the time, many of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s internal systems ran on the AS/400 platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Because it looks like a nuclear device or jet engine, I was able to convince my neighbour that I was generating my own nuclear power from now on, as well as the people at the Chrysler convention that it was an electric engine for a transport truck (I was passing them when going to a high school tech presentation at Bingemans where I used this as a fun prop). My pranks know no bounds!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Mostly, I re-read sci-fi or notable works such as &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (William Gibson) or &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Douglas Adams) since those are the types of books that I kept over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I kept a book from 1989 called &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life with UNIX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Don Libes &amp;amp; Sandy Ressler) that I remember using as a good UNIX reference a long time ago.  While browsing the Net, I happened across a recent review of it that said it was “a timeless book on everything UNIX – 90% of it still applies today.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Below is a timeline of each major console, the CPU/GPU they used and any other neat stuff.  Basically, you will notice two important trends:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The console manufacturers love to copy each other - up to the mid-1980s, they mostly had MOS 6502-based CPUs - in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they had Motorola 68000-based CPUs - in the mid-1990s to early 2000s they mostly had MIPS-based RISC CPUs - and today they all have PowerPC-based RISC CPUs and complex GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And this next week I plan to do nothing but relax, get a tan, drink “Muskoka Dry Pale Ginger Ale” and read a few books that I haven’t had the time to open yet.  And yes, my daughter is going to swim all week long - that is her in the water with the kids from the cottage next door.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now you are probably wondering why I am blogging on my vacation&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;shouldn’t a vacation be devoid of TV/phones/Internet/computers?  Well, in a way, I am abandoning technology for the whole week - I am writing this blog on a greyscale PowerBook 140 (1992), saving my work in ClarisWorks to a floppy, and transporting it to my current Macintosh when I return via an external USB floppy drive.  How RETRO!  Now that is what I call “roughing it”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He specifically noted that thin clients (like the  HP Compaq t5125 which only uses 10 Watts of power compared to the 550 Watts used by most computers) could easily provide low-power, high-performance computing on a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But what I noticed is that Apple didn’t create a whole new look for them - essentially, the new line is in the same beautiful package as the iMac G5 and PowerBook.  These designs must be very good if Apple is going to stick with them, and as a result, are key turning points in Mac evolution.   Does evolutionary theory apply to computers.  I think so.  As I am sure the famous Richard Dawkins would point out, there must be some point where we could trace the current models of computers back to common motherboard architecture&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While my daughter checked out the educational exhibits (obviously learning important information), I was more impressed by the fact that some exhibits that haven&amp;rsquo;t changed for several years are still powered by Mac Classics! And to boot, the exhibits were still pretty damn good with those old computers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Steve Wozniak provided the technical genius for computer creation, while Steve Jobs provided the expertise in marketing and design. Their first major commercially adopted product was the Apple II in 1977, which had a MOS 6502 CPU (also used in Commodore computers such as the Commodore 64) and shipped with BASIC and the DOS operating system (later versions). The Apple II was very well built and had tons of expansion ports. It inspired thousands of people to enter the computer world. Thousands of programs were made for it, and it made its way into nearly every industry in a short period of time. The famous spreadsheet, Visicalc, made the Apple II a great business tool, its ease of use made it extremely popular in the school system (every school I went to had them, even in the 1990s), and its BASIC interpreter and easy expandability made it famous with hackers, engineers and scientists (the first demonstration of public key cryptography was hacked together by a few mathematicians on an Apple II).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;parenting&#34;&gt;Parenting&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am a happily divorced proud father of one. I’ve pretty much raised my daughter since she was 5 years old on my own, and yes, I’ve made school lunches, threw kids parties, went to great places (Ontario Science Centre, ROM, SportsWorld, Storybook Gardens, Disney World and more!), spent vacations camping/cottaging, and watched far too many Land Before Time movies. The picture on the left is my daughter while we were vacationing at Disney World in Florida over a decade ago. Now that my daughter is grown up, I miss those years. But she recently became a parent herself, so in a few years I&amp;rsquo;ll likely be doing some of those things as a grandparent. After my daughter moved out of the house, my adorable dog Pepper and I went on many more amazing adventures until she &lt;a href=&#34;../../myblog/remembering-pepper/&#34;&gt;passed away at the age of 13&lt;/a&gt;. I am incredibly grateful to have been a dad to both my daughter and Pepper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
