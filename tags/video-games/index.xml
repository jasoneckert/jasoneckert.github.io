      <title>The Time I Yoga-Balled an Apple Store Employee</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the late 2000s, my teenage daughter and I went to a local mall one weekend to do some shopping. As usual, I insisted we drop into the Apple store before leaving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The store itself was quite busy. There were people playing with nearly every item on display at the tables near the front of the store, and even more people hovering around those people to catch a glimpse of what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I finally beat Tetris!</title>

I accidentally smashed the neck of the CRT monitor when removing it, so I installed a Wells-Gardner arcade LCD (which takes the CGA video signals generated by the Atari Tetris game PCB inside the cabinet), as well as a matching HAPP bezel to make it look great, as shown below. And I’ve played it quite a bit - Tetris has always been one of my favourite games, and is a great way of relieving stress and regaining focus after a long day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I can’t think of many years in the past decade that had the same amount of academic, physical, and personal fulfillment all in one year!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the academic side, I presented a 12-week Linux+ webinar series at night to IT instructors worldwide for the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA)  Instructor Network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, fit well since I just finished writing the 5th edition of my Linux textbook for Cengage (Linux+ &amp;amp; LPIC Guide to Linux Certification).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I actually got two new arcade games this year. The first one was an arcade machine I never thought I’d find in good working condition. It’s also the absolute coolest arcade game of the 1980s with its amazing vector graphics (as well as my all-time favourite arcade game)&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.Atari’s Tempest!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why you should buy an old arcade machine</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/myblog/why-you-should-buy-an-old-arcade-machine/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why on earth would anyone want to buy a video game the size of a refrigerator?!?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The simple answer: It’s the best bang for your buck!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the dawn of video games in the 1970s, video game makers have been all about making as much money as they can.  Today, a game console will cost you about $500, and the games anywhere from $40-80 each on top of it. - if you go the Nintendo route, expect to sink just as much if not more.  A gaming PC is even more expensive, and the games will run you even more than console games when you get hooked.  Mobile gaming is somewhat inexpensive if you don’t mind seeing plenty of ads, and don’t spend money to unlock the cool features of each game (a marketing technique called micro-transactions). It’s big business, and you don’t get good gameplay value, even if you spend all day playing the games.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It’s a great way to reflect on the events that have happened during the year, and to honest, is actually a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;2016b.jpg#right&#34; alt=&#34;2016b&#34; title=&#34;2016b&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just a quick disclaimer: I have no intention of talking about the shallow-but-popular celebrity death fixation that has taken over the Internet (must be a millennial thing).  That being said, when I heard that Prince died, it led me to watch Purple Rain again (great movie), so there’s a plus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And in the early 80s, when home game consoles were all the rage, my parents bought us an Atari 2600 (the all-black “Darth Vader” model shown to the right) and some games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We lived in a big old house, and there was a very large, unused room upstairs (we affectionately called “the back room”) that was used as the toy/Atari room. My sister was a few years younger than I was, and didn’t have much interest in the Atari, so I was the one that played it the most.  I remember playing Berzerk on the Atari 2600 until I couldn’t keep my eyes open anymore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As a result, I won’t be getting or restoring any more in 2016 at all (I have a few arcades that I want to work on to upgrade, but that’s about it).  I’ll be spending most of my time playing them!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

People who practice it often listen to, or repeat, a particular sound or mantra in order to reach a relaxed state of consciousness.  It’s been praised by many for decades as a means of lowering stress and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-a-flow-state-within-a-video-game&#34;&gt;What is a “flow state” within a video game?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Video games that require quick thinking, fast reflexes and precision are often difficult to excel at - but with practice, the game can be mastered.  When mastered, the player’s physical precision is almost effortless (encoded in “muscle memory”), the the thought processes seem perfectly natural.  It’s as if your mind is actually “in” the game.  This state is often called “the zone” by gamers, or a “flow state” by psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you regularly post to social media (e.g. Facebook or Twitter), looking back on your posts are a great way to revisit the major events that took place during the year. Better yet, by summarizing them in a blog post (as I’m doing here), you’ll preserve those events for posterity and make it easy to revisit them in distant years too!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And we hosted a hub at our Kitchener campus again for the whole weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;gca2.jpg#center&#34; alt=&#34;GCA2&#34; title=&#34;GCA2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;gca3.jpg#right&#34; alt=&#34;GCA3&#34; title=&#34;GCA3&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, this year&amp;rsquo;s GCA went incredibly well – everyone was pumped and loved the experience!  We had students from three different campuses attend the event (Kitchener, Hamilton and London), and all teams managed to complete some amazing games and submit them before the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This Labour Day weekend is the final time that you can check it out as it closes Sept 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our college (triOS College) was the presenting sponsor for the exhibition, which, for me was incredible - not only because I run our video game program, created the information for our game development booth, gave numerous Ontario Science Centre talks on gaming topics, and helped organize various game-themed events - but because I’m an avid retro gamer who has many of the same arcade machines and vintage consoles showcased in Game On 2.0 in my own home!  For me, it was like merging my home and work lives. I could actually bring my personal passion and knowledge of retro gaming into my day job!  Not many people can say that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, if you are an avid reader of “idea” books (for lack of a better word), then you also know that some people understand it poorly at best.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the book &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Shallows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Nicholas Carr.  Carr argues that the Internet has reduced our ability to carefully reason through problems and use our imagination.  And plenty of people have taken the time to carefully point out the flaws in his views.  And you can do it easily - just take a few moments to reflect on what you do to accomplish some of the small tasks you perform today.  Now think of those same small tasks 20 years ago, and what you had to do to accomplish them back then - you’ll see a world of difference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They create a sense of optimism about what “can” be accomplished in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Atari’s Pong was one of the first technologies to do this because it allowed us to interact with our televisions, instead of just watching them.  And we started thinking about the types of wonderful interactions that the future would bring to our televisions, video displays, and Holodecks (for the trekkies out there).  We defended the earth against Space Invaders, and we lived in the virtual world of Tron.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The focus was on following this generic structure, and not necessarily on understanding the material or building knowledge in additional areas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, some kids would understand many of these topics in good depth and be able to relate them to other topics easily - they were labelled the “smart” kids by their peers.  I was labelled as one of the “smart” kids back when I was in school, but I also did a great deal of extra research and exploration on topics I wanted to learn more about.  The rest of my class just followed the structure as best they could, which was perfectly acceptable by school standards at the time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

DIG stands for Digital, Interactive &amp;amp; Gaming, and is essentially a large conference in London, Ontario that brings together the interactive, game, and digital media companies for both networking and educational/informative sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although this year’s DIG conference was a bit smaller than last year, there were more industry professionals present, and far more meaningful conversation! Instead of the regular “hello&amp;hellip;.what do you do&amp;hellip;.let’s exchange business cards” stuff that normally goes on at these conferences, I got plenty of time to actually have in-depth discussions with dozens of different app and game developers on what was working for them, what challenges they’ve had, as well as their views on the industry and the future. I’ve never enjoyed a conference more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you destroy all of the enemies on Stage 1 except for the left two enemies (shown to the right), then dodge their fire for about 10-15 minutes, they stop firing at you.  At this point, you can safely kill them and no enemies will fire at you for the remainder of the game (they can still crash into you to kill you though).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I loved the graphics, shading, storyline, stealth gameplay (quite frustrating at times) - everything.   In fact, I love the whole Splinter Cell series.  Best yet, this series is developed almost entirely at the Ubisoft Toronto studio right now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It just took place this past weekend (Sept 7th - 9th), and was a huge undertaking for Mickey and I, but in the end it turned out amazingly well!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The college was very good at coordinating the event (somewhat last minute because of a staff change), and Microsoft was incredibly generous - they provided a ton of food (Tim Hortons breakfast each day, and a big lunch each day), t-shirts, giveaways, prizes (Microsoft ArcTouch mice for the winners, and a Windows Phone for the GoDevMental draw).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to properly pronounce Galaga</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;galagalogo.png#right&#34; alt=&#34;Galaga logo&#34; title=&#34;Galaga logo&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been getting some heat over the past short while when I talk about my Galaga arcade, because there are 2 different camps when it comes to pronouncing the word Galaga.  You can either emphasize the first syllable:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    GAL-a-ga&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or you can emphasize the second syllable:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    ga-LAG-a&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always emphasized the second syllable (ga-LAG-a).  However, the Avengers movie came out this year, and Robert Downey Jr. (who plays Iron Man in the movie) pronounced the game as GAL-a-ga when it showed up in the movie.  So now, most people say something along the lines of “oh you mean GAL-a-ga” when I mention my ga-LAG-a machine.  Annoying as hell to say the least&amp;hellip;..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Guide to buying old arcade games</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest things to have in your home is a real video arcade game - not only for the nostalgia, but for the massive amount of fun that you, your friends, and your family will have when playing it.  A video arcade game can round out a rec room, basement, or garage more than anything else ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started seriously getting into arcade games last year - I’ve done tons of research prior to actually buying arcade machines for my own home, and I’ve learned a heck of a lot along the way (thank you Internet!).  I hope to share some of what I’ve learned in this post to benefit those who are thinking of buying a home video arcade game (or additional ones).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read an article on Ars Technica yesterday that didn’t sit too well with me: &lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/04/what-ever-happened-to-the-american-arcade/&#34;&gt;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/04/what-ever-happened-to-the-american-arcade/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now don’t get me wrong&amp;hellip;..I thought it was a great article, and they did a good job of portraying the difference between Japanese and North American culture when it comes to video arcades (which are still very popular in Japan but have pretty much disappeared in North America outside of the Chuck E. Cheese franchise).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Basically twice the work but the same money.  Most of the time it’s a thankless job (because you have to deal with complaints and bitching from everyone), but there is the odd job perk such as flex time and attending social events and conferences.  I think the best part is that my official job description has a section that requires that I possess Strong communications skills (fluent in English &amp;amp; Klingon), as well as excellent interpersonal, analytical, strategic, conflict resolution, management, and organizational skills (this is what happens when non-geek HR people ask you for feedback in creating your job description).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And each time I’ve told people that, they’ve either burst out laughing, gave me the quizzical look (as if I’m joking), or simply state something along the lines of “if it were to happen, it would have happened to you.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I definitely plan on telling people that I threw my back out playing Angry Birds at future events (it is a great ice breaker for sure!).  And if they ask about details, I’ll refer them to this post&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And the home gaming console that led to the most development in this area was the least technologically advanced one for its time:  The 1977 Atari Video Computer System (VCS), later known as the Atari 2600.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Below is a timeline of each major console, the CPU/GPU they used and any other neat stuff.  Basically, you will notice two important trends:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The console manufacturers love to copy each other - up to the mid-1980s, they mostly had MOS 6502-based CPUs - in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they had Motorola 68000-based CPUs - in the mid-1990s to early 2000s they mostly had MIPS-based RISC CPUs - and today they all have PowerPC-based RISC CPUs and complex GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>3. Arcade Games</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the 80s was awesome!  One of the best things about growing up in the 80s for me was that I developed a love of video games.  I loved spending time at the arcade playing the classics like Tempest, Missile Command and Galaga.  At home, we had an Atari 2600 and later a Nintendo NES.  I loved it all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, I purchased my absolute favourite arcade games of all time&amp;hellip;..mainly because I’d rather play those games than most of the newer AAA titles that require a larger amount of available time.  Since I have limited space, I had to make sure they were games I’d play a LOT of, and I’ve definitely kept true to that!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;parenting&#34;&gt;Parenting&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am a happily divorced proud father of one. I’ve pretty much raised my daughter since she was 5 years old on my own, and yes, I’ve made school lunches, threw kids parties, went to great places (Ontario Science Centre, ROM, SportsWorld, Storybook Gardens, Disney World and more!), spent vacations camping/cottaging, and watched far too many Land Before Time movies. The picture on the left is my daughter while we were vacationing at Disney World in Florida over a decade ago. Now that my daughter is grown up, I miss those years. But she recently became a parent herself, so in a few years I&amp;rsquo;ll likely be doing some of those things as a grandparent. After my daughter moved out of the house, my adorable dog Pepper and I went on many more amazing adventures until she &lt;a href=&#34;../../myblog/remembering-pepper/&#34;&gt;passed away at the age of 13&lt;/a&gt;. I am incredibly grateful to have been a dad to both my daughter and Pepper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;martinamis.png&#34; alt=&#34;pic from Invasion of the Space Invaders&#34; title=&#34;pic from Invasion of the Space Invaders&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;martin-amis-invasion-of-the-space-invaders-1982&#34;&gt;Martin Amis: Invasion of the Space Invaders (1982)&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most sought-after video game book of the 1980s by the uber-famous, world-renowned author Martin Amis (most copies sell for over $200 today). Martin Amis has a unique way of bringing you back to the video game world of 1978-1982 using verbal imagery and humour - after all, he was a video game addict at the time! Some of the high-resolution colour photos in the book (including the one above) say more than words ever could. The last half of the book is an in-depth look at some of the most common video games alongside Martin’s favourite game strategies that will land you a high score.  And to top it all off, it has a wicked introduction by Steven Spielberg.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
