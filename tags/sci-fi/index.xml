      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re tired of all of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) buzz recently, you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. Most of us in the tech industry are as well.

      <description>Thomas J. Ryan: The Adolescence of P-1 (1977) This is probably the best book I have ever read regarding our human desire for artificial intelligence (AI). It’s about a University of Waterloo student who creates an AI on IBM mainframes. Don’t let that bore you though - it’s a captivating read and has a great ending. I wouldn’t be surprised if this book influenced later movies such as War Games (1983), and books such as Neuromancer (1984).</description>
