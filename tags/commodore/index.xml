From the signature, it was painted in 1983 by what looks like T., N., or M. McLaughlin:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2. Retro Computers</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;apple&#34;&gt;Apple&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;appleiic.jpg#right&#34; alt=&#34;Apple IIc&#34; title=&#34;Apple IIc&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple Computer was founded by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1976. Steve Wozniak provided the technical genius for computer creation, while Steve Jobs provided the expertise in marketing and design. Their first major commercially adopted product was the Apple II in 1977, which had a MOS 6502 CPU (also used in Commodore computers such as the Commodore 64) and shipped with BASIC and the DOS operating system (later versions). The Apple II was very well built and had tons of expansion ports. It inspired thousands of people to enter the computer world. Thousands of programs were made for it, and it made its way into nearly every industry in a short period of time. The famous spreadsheet, Visicalc, made the Apple II a great business tool, its ease of use made it extremely popular in the school system (every school I went to had them, even in the 1990s), and its BASIC interpreter and easy expandability made it famous with hackers, engineers and scientists (the first demonstration of public key cryptography was hacked together by a few mathematicians on an Apple II).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
