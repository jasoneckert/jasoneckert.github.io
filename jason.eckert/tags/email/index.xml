      <description>You know - most technologies change drastically over time. As a result, I got my hands on an old BlackBerry 950 model from 1998 (the 850/950 series were the original BlackBerry smartphones on the 800/900 MHz Mobitex networks, respectively).
The problem is this: It really hasn’t changed that much. Aside from the color and graphics, the BlackBerry 950 running BlackBerry Device Software 2.5 had pretty much the same applications and functionality as the BlackBerry 8830 running BlackBerry Device Software 4.</description>

      <description>I haven’t posted for a while simply because I just got back from vacation today rejuvenated. In IT, you either take vacation or spend tons of $$ on therapy and alcohol. I prefer the vacation :-)
People still email me during my vacation, but I have an Outlook autoreply email configured to let them know that I won’t be replying anytime soon (it’s your basic “fuck off and die because I am on vacation” email).</description>
