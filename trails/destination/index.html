<h1 id="rockwood-conservation-area">Rockwood Conservation Area</h1>
<p>Rockwood has breathtaking scenery - pine and cedar forests surrounding rock cliffs and islands along the Eramosa River. And the trails allow you to see it all. The Cedar Ridge Outlook allows you to see all of Rockwood below. The plateau at the top of the caves is actually owned by the University of Waterloo, but you can hike up there and along the numerous trails to see the remnants of an old house and quarry.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="elora-gorge-conservation-area">Elora Gorge Conservation Area</h1>
<p>Elora Gorge borders the Grand River with 22-meter-high cliffs and is popular with tubers that enjoy the white-water rapids. The trail parking lot allows you to follow the south side of the gorge through beautiful forests and several outlooks (including one that goes through the rock). From there you can cross a bridge that takes you to north side of the gorge and down metal stairs to the riverbed where you can walk along rocky plateaus and in the river to enjoy the landscape. From there, you can walk along the north side of the gorge trail past the campgrounds, across the low bridge that marks the end of the tubing run, and back to the trail entrance on the south side.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="cottontail-road-trail">Cottontail Road Trail</h1>
<p>This trail starts opposite the entrance to the Elora Gorge Conservation Area. It&rsquo;s a long linear trail between farmland that is easy to hike, but is quite beautiful as it is bordered by mature trees (including hundreds of apple trees).</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="health-valley-trail">Health Valley Trail</h1>
<p>Stretching from downtown St. Jacobs to the outskirts of Waterloo, this trail isn&rsquo;t something that can be easily accessed by public transit. But it&rsquo;s beautiful. It winds along the Conestogo River, through an old farmer&rsquo;s field (with cows!), and past the famous Wise Old Oak. You&rsquo;ll even see a roped off section with Giant Hogweed.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="hilton-falls-conservation-area">Hilton Falls Conservation Area</h1>
<p>If someone asked me what the most beautiful conservation area is in all of Halton region, I&rsquo;d have to say Hilton Falls because there is so much to love. It has two breathtaking waterfalls and an immense number of gorgeous trails that wind through breathtaking wetlands and forests. It&rsquo;s impossible to walk all of the trails in a day - or even a week - but I&rsquo;ve explored and love every inch of this massive place. There is also a large communal fire pit and log pile at the top of the main falls that is kept lit by the rangers where you can roast hot dogs or marshmallows.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="britton-complex">Britton Complex</h1>
<p>This is a series of six tracts situated directly north and west of Hilton Falls: <em><strong>Britton Tract</strong></em>, <em><strong>Turner Tract</strong></em>, <em><strong>Robertson Tract</strong></em>, <em><strong>Mahon Tract</strong></em>, <em><strong>Currie Tract</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Cox Tract</strong></em>. Because of this, they share many of the same geological features and breathtaking scenery as Hilton Falls, but each have their own unique features. They are beautifully maintained by <a href="https://www.hafta.ca/">HAFTA</a> and consist of wide main trails, boardwalks, and numerous side trails that are suitable for both hikers and adventurous bikers.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="crawford-lake-conservation-area">Crawford Lake Conservation Area</h1>
<p>Crawford Lake is a stunning meromictic lake with aqua blue water that was recently used by scientists to mark the <a href="https://canadiangeographic.ca/articles/the-anthropocene-is-here-and-tiny-crawford-lake-has-been-chosen-as-the-global-ground-zero/">beginning of the Anthropocene</a>. It&rsquo;s surrounded by a beautiful boardwalk, numerous trails, and an outlook along the Niagara Escarpment. I especially recommend spending the day to hike the Nassagaweya Canyon Trail down to the valley at the bottom of the escarpment and up the other side to Rattlesnake Point (and back again).</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="rattlesnake-point-conservation-area">Rattlesnake Point Conservation Area</h1>
<p>Nestled at the top of massive rock cliffs that form part of the Niagara Escarpment, Rattlesnake Point is popular with rock climbers. The rocky trails run along the cliff edge and are loads of fun, as are the stairs that allow you to descend along the cliff wall. I especially recommend spending the day to hike the Nassagaweya Canyon Trail down to the valley at the bottom of the escarpment and up the other side to Crawford Lake (and back again).</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="mount-nemo-conservation-area">Mount Nemo Conservation Area</h1>
<p>Similar to Rattlesnake Point, most of the trails at Mount Nemo run along high cliffs along the Niagara Escarpment. But the scenery at Mount Nemo is even more breathtaking, especially if you descend down the cliffs to the bottom on the Escarpment Edge Trail. The cliffs are so high that you can look down to see Turkey Vultures circling below or look east to see the CN Tower in the distance. There&rsquo;s also a beautiful former quarry with massive cliffs in the middle of the conservation area that you can hike down to.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="kelso-conservation-area">Kelso Conservation Area</h1>
<p>Kelso is one of those places that has it all - a beautiful beach, boardwalks, nature centre, professional obstacle courses, ski hills, and a massive number of gorgeous hiking trails through varied forests at the top of the Niagara Escarpment. The picture at the top of this page is of my dog Pepper and I on a rock plateau at the top of the escarpment.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="dundas-valley-conservation-area">Dundas Valley Conservation Area</h1>
<p>This is a massive area with 40km of well-maintained trails that weave through Carolinian forests, glacial moraine valleys with lovely streams and waterfalls, historic ruins, and beautiful meadows.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="snyders-flats-conservation-area">Snyder’s Flats Conservation Area</h1>
<p>A massive area that used to be a gravel pit, Snyder&rsquo;s Flats has been beautifully restored with lakes (including one that has crystal clear water that people and dogs love to swim in) and many trails that pass through breathtaking grasslands, ponds, and beautiful forests. Some trails run along the Grand River that Snyder&rsquo;s Flats borders on that allow for access to the river. You&rsquo;ll also find many tasty apple trees along both sides of the main trail from the parking lot.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="starkey-hill-conservation-area">Starkey Hill Conservation Area</h1>
<p>This is a 4km trail that runs through steep forested slopes and wetlands that is beautiful in every season and has many interpretive signs (via QR code). The summit is actually the highest point in Puslinch Township, and you can see the twin towers of the Basilica of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception (a Roman Catholic church in Guelph) in the distance.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="smith-property-loop-trail">Smith Property Loop Trail</h1>
<p>This trail runs through beautiful cedar forests along the Eramosa River and then winds up to a magnificent pine plantation forest (the largest I&rsquo;ve seen in Ontario), before winding down back to the entrance.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="puslinch-tract-conservation-area">Puslinch Tract Conservation Area</h1>
<p>Puslinch Tract is one of my favourite trails of all time because of its breathtaking charm. There are 18km of trails that traverse every possible type of terrain, field, and forest you could imagine. There are two beautiful lakes on the west side, and numerous ponds and wetlands on the east side. I must have taken my dog here over a thousand times, exploring every inch of the place. I even bought a Lowrance Endura GPS a decade ago just to keep track of the trails we visited before Alltrails picked up traction in Canada.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="vance-tract">Vance Tract</h1>
<p>This is a great short hike that consists of two loops. The north loop goes through pine plantation forest, and the south loop goes along both cedar and mixed pine forests. There is a narrow path through the wetlands that connect both loops, but it&rsquo;s often flooded by water at two spots during the spring and summer, so be prepared to jump along tree branches to cross.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="fletcher-creek-ecological-preserve">Fletcher Creek Ecological Preserve</h1>
<p>This is a beautiful and rewarding hike along cedar and mixed forests that ends at an old, rehabilitated quarry with beautiful ponds and wetlands. There&rsquo;s a boardwalk that traverses the pond, as well as ruins from old quarry structures.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="fwr-dickson-wilderness-area">F.W.R Dickson Wilderness Area</h1>
<p>This trail has a beautiful boardwalk along wetlands and swamp that is rife with birds. It also winds along hardwood forests around a small lake, as well as through tall-grass prairie and willow-dogwood thickets.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="dryden-tract">Dryden Tract</h1>
<p>This tract has the largest and nicest set of trails in the area directly southwest of Cambridge. It consists of massive glacial moraine hills lined with trees that are breathtaking in every season. There&rsquo;s a lot of elevation changes and scenery to take in, as well as a prairie summit where you can look across the landscape southwest of the tract. The place is so big, it&rsquo;s easy to get lost (we did on our first trip), but there are far worse places to get lost in :-)</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="drynan-tract">Drynan Tract</h1>
<p>Like the nearby Dryden Tract, Drynan Tract is mostly glacial moraine forest. But Drynan also has low-lying marshes, ponds, and lakes that are beautiful with their abundant wildlife (including the rare Blanding&rsquo;s turtle).</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="sudden-tract">Sudden Tract</h1>
<p>While Sudden Tract is near both the Dryden and Drynan Tracts and comprised of mostly glacial moraine forest, it has a very different feel. There are numerous high narrow ridges and low valleys that have the largest ferns I&rsquo;ve seen in Ontario. The trails are amazing, and there are several boardwalks that allow you to enjoy the breathtaking low-lying areas, including numerous swamps, vernal pools, and a large wetland.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="little-tract">Little Tract</h1>
<p>This is one of my favourite local trails in every season. It has several 5km loops that stretch between two parking lots and run up and down hills of Carolinian and pine forests, as well as around beautiful swamp areas. I&rsquo;ve come here countless times with my dog to unwind and relax, and each time it was amazing.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="chesney-wilderness-area-trail">Chesney Wilderness Area Trail</h1>
<p>Chesney is a beautiful trail for walking at any time of the year, even though it looks like the GRCA has stopped maintaining it for many years. You&rsquo;ll find gnarly 200-year-old maple trees lining the main path at the beginning of the trail that look gorgeous in the summer and downright creepy in the fall near dusk. When the bog is frozen in the winter, or when it is mostly dry in the summer, you can find and walk on the remains of the boardwalk that comprised the beautiful Hemlock Trail (named for the abundance of Eastern Hemlock trees).</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="cambridge-to-paris-rail-trail">Cambridge-to-Paris Rail Trail</h1>
<p>This trail is part of an abandoned rail line the runs along the Grand River from Cambridge to Paris. There&rsquo;s beautiful forests and scenery throughout, but it&rsquo;s very long. As a result, you&rsquo;ll want to do it in sections starting from either the parking lot in Paris, Cambridge, or Glen Morris (the halfway point).</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="mono-cliffs-provincial-park">Mono Cliffs Provincial Park</h1>
<p>This park has many trails that go along the top of two different sections of the Niagara Escarpment, as well as along the valleys between them. You&rsquo;ll find stunning scenery, varied forests, lakes and ponds with crystal-clear water, as well as stunning lookout. But be prepared for some extreme changes in elevation (it&rsquo;s a great workout!).</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="baden-hills-regional-forest">Baden Hills Regional Forest</h1>
<p>While this isn&rsquo;t a large area, there are several trails that traverses a very high and beautiful forested hill. The trails along the west and east slopes are very steep and slippery, so you&rsquo;ll need to bring a walking stick and grab onto trees as you navigate them. But it&rsquo;s a rewarding hike with plenty of opportunity for cardio.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="the-hydrocut-petersburg-regional-forest">The Hydrocut (Petersburg Regional Forest)</h1>
<p>This is a series of pro cycling trails that wind through picturesque forest areas. Many of the trails are shared use (i.e., cyclers and hikers), so you can enjoy the scenery more than the cyclers.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="petersburg-crown-lands">Petersburg Crown Lands</h1>
<p>This 4km trail stretches along the south side of Hwy7/8 west of Kitchener. It consists of a beautiful trail loop that goes through varied forests with giant pines and maples, and an extension that ends at Alder Creek. It&rsquo;s one of those hikes that is perfect for relaxing and unwinding.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="sandy-hills-pinery-trail">Sandy Hills Pinery Trail</h1>
<p>This area actually consists of two sets of trails that reside on the south and north sides of Sandy Hills Drive. Both sides have numerous trailways that snake through gorgeous pine forest that looks and smells amazing any time of the year.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="benham-tract">Benham Tract</h1>
<p>This trail is a hidden gem. You&rsquo;ll find stunning forest views with plenty of steep hills and massive trees. While not a huge tract, it has plenty of trails that wind through it, and you&rsquo;ll want to explore all of them. Excellent cardio!</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="limehouse-conservation-area">Limehouse Conservation Area</h1>
<p>In addition to the ruins of a huge lime kiln and ancient powderhouse, Limehouse has several beautiful trails. One part has you navigate down two ladders into the rocky crevices of the Niagara Escarpment, while another runs along the gorgeous Black Creek. And everything is beautifully maintained.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="hockley-valley-provincial-park">Hockley Valley Provincial Park</h1>
<p>This park has some of the most beautiful hiking trails in all of Ontario, but it&rsquo;s not for the faint of heart. Massive, forested hills and valleys make for some of the best cardio you&rsquo;ll get on a hike. There are plenty of bridges that cross streams that weave throughout the low-lying areas of the trail, as well as dozens of breathtaking views.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="boyne-valley-provincial-park">Boyne Valley Provincial Park</h1>
<p>This park has some incredible trails. You&rsquo;ll climb up and down beautiful, forested hills and valleys along the Boyne River basin, traverse stunning rolling grass meadows, and climb a kame (Murphy&rsquo;s Pinnacle) with a spectacular view. A full hike is about 16km on both the east and west side of the park, but it&rsquo;s well worth it.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="wilfred-crozier-nature-reserve">Wilfred Crozier Nature Reserve</h1>
<p>This nature reserve just east of Hilton Falls Conservation Area, along with the Bruce trail sections that go through it to the Speyside Natural Area hold absolutely beautiful terrain. You can see all the way to Toronto from the edge of the Niagara Escarpment, and the numerous rocky forest side trails have many stunning lakes and marshes.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="splitrock-narrows-nature-reserve">Splitrock Narrows Nature Reserve</h1>
<p>This nature reserve just north of Mono Cliffs Provincial Park is beautiful. A portion of the trail takes you down a rocky alley next to the Niagara Escarpment (hence the name), but also has beautiful forest trails and a wide variety of different trees and beautiful landscape. The far end of the trail is just a short walk from the Walter Tovell side trail leading to Mono Cliffs from where you can walk to the lookout and McCarston&rsquo;s Lake.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="mountsberg-conservation-area">Mountsberg Conservation Area</h1>
<p>Not too far from Hwy 401, this large conservation area along the Mountsberg reservoir has two large trails that traverse beautiful marsh and forest areas, with some beautiful views. There is an amazing Raptor Centre where you can see a large number of live eagles, hawks, and owls, as which has regular amphitheater shows. There&rsquo;s also an osprey viewing platform on the Mountsberg reservoir. In the middle is Mapletown &ndash; a western-style event area with night lighting, outdoor fire pits, and multiple buildings hosting maple-syrup themed demonstrations and stores. It&rsquo;s very popular in the winter, where you can take a horse drawn sleigh ride to it.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="robert-edmondson">Robert Edmondson</h1>
<p>This is a small trail (about 2.5 km), but one that is great to do on a wet day, or if you just want a quick forest refresh. It has a large boardwalk section that traverses a high canopy forest with a fern floor, as well as beautiful forest trails that smell great after a rain. Near the entrance, there&rsquo;s a pond where you&rsquo;ll see people fishing from the shore or deck platform.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="long-point-provincial-park-and-big-creek-national-wildlife-area">Long Point Provincial Park and Big Creek National Wildlife Area</h1>
<p>Long Point is a sand-spit peninsula on Lake Erie known for having some of the best sandy beaches in Ontario south of Wasaga, along with several campgrounds. You can hike past these campgrounds along scenic dunes that lead to the Long Point National Wildlife Area &ndash; a protected biosphere reserve home to a rich variety of waterfowl and migratory birds.</p>
<p>At the base of the peninsula lies the Big Creek National Wildlife Area, a vast and ecologically important wetland home to a diverse array of plants, birds, snakes, toads, butterflies, and turtles. A long trail winds through the area along canals, offering access to viewing platforms with sweeping views of the remote marshland.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="point-pelee-national-park">Point Pelee National Park</h1>
<p>Although I mentioned that these destination trails are within a two hour drive from the Tri-Cities region (Kitchener, Cambridge, Waterloo) of Southwestern Ontario, I&rsquo;m including this one as it&rsquo;s just a bit over a two hour drive, and well worth it. This park has over 12 km of hiking trails through beautiful Carolinian woodland and marsh, and along beautiful beaches. It&rsquo;s also the southernmost mainland tip of Canada, with a massive observation tower and trail (or shuttle if you don&rsquo;t want to walk) to the actual tip. Because of its unique climate, it&rsquo;s the most ecologically diverse park in Canada, and you&rsquo;ll see a tremendous amount of wildlife, bugs, reptiles, and birds &ndash; there is even an a covered bird viewing building near the tip entrance where birds fly in and perch on the poles the park has designed for this purpose.</p>
