Welcome to my homepage!  I am definitely not a huge fan of personal homepages, so this one is designed for my friends, family, students, arch-enemies, creditors, and pretty much anyone else who has a web browser.  More specifically, you will find good information about anything nerd-related on this site - enjoy!

I am a teacher, computer consultant and leading author in the college computing market (to see my books, click on the link in the left pane).  In addition, I have taught computer science at triOS College in Ontario since 1998 and have obtained many <A HREF="data/index.html">certifications</A> in that time. Although most of my books have been on Linux and I largely teach Windows XP/2003, my preferred operating system at home is UNIX (Solaris on UltraSPARC, IRIX on MIPS, and Macintosh OS X on PowerPC).

<B>Linux rocks!</B> - 11/16/2004 5:13:22 PM<BR>I have been a die-hard Linux advocate since its conception.  As a result, I usually get asked to write Linux columns for various magazines from time to time (I think I have done about a dozen or more of these in the last 5 years).  Someone asked me about this today and I gave them a link to one of my later ones (that I like).  It was for a Course Technology catalog and is more up-to-date; to read it, <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20080724174248/http://www.course.com/itlink/fall04_futurewithlinux.cfm">click here.</A>

<B>Do theories of evolution apply to computers?</B> - 09/27/2004 11:07:11 AM<BR>With a bit of Internet research, I found some surprising evidence that hints this is indeed the case - to see for yourself, <A HREF="images/evolution.JPG">click here</A>.

<B>Home networking for kids!</B> - 09/08/2004 4:10:11 PM<BR>I saw this <A HREF="images/book.JPG">book</A> when I was browsing a bookstore in the mall and had to take a quick browse through it.  It's just another symbol of the importance of networking today - I wish we had that technology when I was 10 years old....

<B>Old Macs never die.....</B> - 08/18/2004 8:12:31 PM<BR>We just came back from the Ontario Science Centre today.  While my daughter checked out the educational exhibits (obviously learning important information), I was more impressed by the fact that some exhibits that haven't changed for several years are still powered by Mac Classics!  And to boot, the exhibits were still pretty damn good with those old computers. <A HREF="images/mac.JPG">Here is a picture of my daughter beside a Mac Classic II at a rainforest exhibit!</A>
