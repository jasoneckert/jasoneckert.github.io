Frequently Asked Questions

<FONT face="verdana,geneva,helvetica" color="#000000" size="-1">
<P> 
<B>Q.</B> Do I really have to memorize all the stuff from class? <BR>
<B>A.</B> Yes, absolutely - if I had to do it, so must you. It's called masochism.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> Do students have a say in class policies and procedures? <BR>
<B>A.</B> No. Any class with Jason is a petty tyranny and he is the petty tyrant. Voting is incontheivable. 
<P>
<B>Q.</B> What is a MAD chip? <BR>
<B>A.</B> MAD (Mood Activated Device) is a special EEPROM chip found in modern motherboards.  Any problems that are difficult to solve are typically the result of this MAD chip.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> How are marks tabulated at the end of a course? <BR>
<B>A.</B> To save administration, all marks will be randomly generated using a small JAVA program - this mark is then increased or decreased depending on how much I like the student.  Any discrepancies between actual student performance and the end-of-course mark is entirely the result of the MAD chip in my computer that is running the JAVA program.

<P>
<B>Q.</B> How can I improve the non-randomly-generated portion of my mark? <BR>
<B>A.</B> Easy. Laugh at Jason's jokes, applaud his poetry, publicy declare his greatness, pun outrageously, and bring stuff from thinkgeek.com to class. (Doing your homework doesn't hurt, either).
