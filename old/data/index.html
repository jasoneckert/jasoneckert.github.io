Certification is fast becoming a benchmark for companies that hire people for computer-related jobs. This is especially important for people entering the computer industry and applying for jobs in medium to large companies.  For me, I don't think certification will be the deciding factor on my resume anymore but what the heck......they are fun to write every so often ;-)
