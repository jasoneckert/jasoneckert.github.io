What if Dr. Seuss wrote about computer networking?

<FONT face="verdana,geneva,helvetica" color="#000000" size="-1">
<P>
If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,<BR>
And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort,<BR>
And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort,<BR>
Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!<BR>
<P>
If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash,<BR>
And the double-clicking icons put your window in the trash,<BR>
And your data is corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash,<BR>
Then your situation's hopeless, and your system's gonna crash!<BR>
<P>
If the label on your cable on the gable at your house,<BR>
Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse,<BR>
But your packets want to tunnel to another protocol,<BR>
That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall.<BR>
<P>
And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss,<BR>
So your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse,<BR>
Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang,<BR>
'Cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang!<BR>
<P>
When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk,<BR>
And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary RISC,<BR>
Then you have to flash your memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM,<BR>
Quickly turn off your computer and be sure to tell your mom!<BR>
