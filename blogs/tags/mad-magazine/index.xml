      <description>This past week, MAD Magazine announced that, after 67 years, it would cease publication by the end of the year. Maybe it shouldn’t be surprising - print magazines have been going extinct for almost two decades already. I honestly can’t remember the last time I bought a magazine of any kind.
The Internet has killed print publication just like video killed the radio star.
But I’m sad for MAD. I have many fond memories of it growing up in the 1980s.</description>
