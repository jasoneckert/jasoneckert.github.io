<div title="Video game genres and characters">
  <div class="width3 height3">
  <span class="big"><p>Similar to movie genres (action, horror, and so on), you can identify a set of genres to categorize almost every game. These genres have come into being over the years as games have been released with similar game mechanics and gameplay. More and more games today combine more than one genre.  </p>
<BR>
<p> Common genres include:  <b><u>traditional games</u></b>, <b><u>sports games</u></b>, <b><u>racing games</u></b>, <b><u>fighting games</u></b>, <b><u>puzzle games</u></b>, <b><u>platformer games</u></b>, <b><u>Real Time Strategy (RTS) games</u></b>, <b><u>Role Playing Games (RPGs)</u></b>, <b><u>First Person Shooters (FPS)</u></b>, <b><u>shoot-em-ups (shmups)</u></b>, <b><u>action-adventure games</u></b>, <b><u>simulation games</u></b>, <b><u>music games</u></b>, <b><u>open world games</u></b>, and <b><u>party games</u></b>.</p>
<BR>
<p> The player interacts with the game through a character in the world called an <b><u>avatar</u></b>.  Games where the user must navigate a virtual world, often have a <b><u>Heads-up Display (HUD)</u></b> that shows the user key information needed about their surroundings and the game itself. Many games also have computer-generated characters within their game world that the player interacts with in a meaningful way - these are called <b><u>non-player characters (NPCs)</u></b>. </p>
<BR>
<p> Game developers also have special terms that they use when talking about characters during game development.  For example, a graphical representation of a 2D character is called a <b><u>sprite</u></b>, and a 3D character representation is commonly called a <b><u>model</u></b>. For example, Mario and Luigi from <i>Super Mario Bros</i> are sprites, whereas Master Chief from <i>Halo</i> is a model.</p></span>

<div title="8-bit video games">
  <div class="width3">
  <span class="big"><p>Many of the most popular video games from the late 1970s and early 1980s used 8-bit computer processors and blocky, or <b><u>pixelated</u></b> graphics.  As a result, we call these games and graphics <b><u>8-bit</u></b>.</p>
<BR>
<p>8-bit video games didn't have realistic graphics or complex game worlds.  Instead, they had to rely on their simple-yet-addictive gameplay.  Most 8-bit games were very easy to learn, had no definite ending, used simple sound effects and music that were easy to remember.  </p></span>
</div>

  <div class="width2 height2">
  <span class="big"><p>Because of these features, 8-bit video games have become quite popular in the past few years, especially on Web browsers and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, where simple-yet-addictive gameplay is preferred over realistic graphics and complex game worlds.  And 8-bit and 8-bit inspired games can be a lot of fun!  Who wouldn't want to play <i>Pac-man</i>, <i>Galaga</i>, <i>Super Mario Bros</i>, <i>Fez</i>, or <i>Minecraft</i>? </p>
<BR>
<p>8-bit is seen as an art form today.  There are many artists who incorporate 8-bit elements, or reflect on themes from the 8-bit era - you can find many of their pieces showcased at the <b><u>iam8bit</u></b> art gallery in Los Angeles.  There are also many 8-bit musicians who create music called <b><u>chiptune</u></b> using 8-bit sound hardware.  Techno, Electro, and Dubstep musicians frequently incorporate chiptune into their music today.</p></span>

<div title="What is a game world?">
  <div class="width3 height3">
  <span class="big"><p>A game world is an imaginary place in which the events of the game occur.  It is presented by both images (e.g. landscapes) and sounds, and can have a culture, aesthetic, set of moral values and other dimensions.  There are many purposes of a game world, including entertainment, enhancing game play by creating and sustaining interest in the game, or even to sell the game (many gamers purchase games with an enticing game world).  Not all games have a game world, but most do.  Even <i>Space Invaders</i> (1978) had a game world that consisted of black space where aliens descended and fired against the player's laser canon - the player had to hide behind barriers (stations) that were destroyed by alien fire and kill the aliens before they reached Earth (a green line at the bottom of the screen).</p>
<BR>
<p>The level of realism in each game world will vary.  All games, no matter how realistic, require some simplification.  The degree of realism of any aspect of a game can be found on a continuum from highly representational to highly abstract and will also vary with each individual game component.</p>
<BR>
<p>Game modifications or <b><u>game mods</u></b> provide the most freedom within a game by allowing players to modify the game world itself.  This functionality is very popular with hardcore gamers and typically extends the lifespan of a game.  Like game mods, <b><u>level editors</u></b> usually extend the lifespan of a game.  They allow players to construct new levels for a game, including the ability to construct a new landscape, place challenges in it, and write a script for the game engine to run.  This functionality is usually left to hardcore or technically oriented gamers, and requires that tools be included with the game, or obtainable online.  <b><u>Bots</u></b> are also seen frequently in some game worlds.  They are artificially intelligent opponents that the player can program, and allow players to create tougher opponents than the original game included.</p></span>

<div title="Gamification">
  <div class="width3 foo">
  <p><span class="large"><i>"Today, many of us are suffering from a vast and primal hunger. But it is not a hunger for food - it is a hunger for more and better engagement from the world around us ..... We are starving, and our games are feeding us."</i></span> <span class="big">- Jane McGonigal, from her book Reality is Broken (2011)</span></p></div>

<div class="foo width3 height2">
<span class="big"><p>At its core, a video game presents a series of problems that we must solve in order to get to the next level, accomplish a goal (e.g. win the game), or get recognition (e.g. obtain a high score). Many video games today are extremely complex, and could have hundreds of complex rules that the player must master in order to proceed to the next level (called <b><u>leveling up</u></b>).  Games today are often collaborative, and allow players across the Internet to quickly and effectively communicate rules and strategies amongst team members to minimize the time it takes for a new player to learn and enjoy the complexity of the game.</p>
<BR>
<p>In short, video games have evolved into a collaborative tool that can be used to both educate and engage people in solving problems.  Organizations (schools, businesses, military) are increasingly adopting and creating games for this purpose - a trend called <b><u>gamification</u></b>.  And gamification works!   By playing a game developed by scientists at the University of Washington, gamers were able to map out a protein that causes AIDS in rhesus monkeys in just 10 days - a problem that stumped scientists for 15 years!</p></span>

<div title="Bugs, glitches and cheats">
  <div class="cld width2 height2">
<span class="big"><p><b><u>Bugs</u></b> are flaws within video games that cause unexpected results, and are often called <b><u>glitches</u></b>. In a typical video game today, nearly all bugs are fixed before the game is released, and the remaining bugs are fixed after players discover them.<p> 
<BR>
<p>One of the most famous bugs discovered after a game was released is the <i>Pac-Man</i> split-screen bug.  Although its developers designed <i>Pac-Man</i> to have an infinite number of levels, there is a bug in the game logic that prevents players from going beyond level 255.  At level 255, the right half of the screen fills up with seemingly random symbols, and prevents the player from completing the level.  The game designers didn't find out about this bug until some talented gamers actually got to level 255!</p></span>

  </div>
<div class="cld width3">
<span class="big"><p>Some bugs aren't even bugs at all!  They are backdoors or debugging codes, called <b><u>cheats</u></b>, that game developers put in the game to allow for special features.    </p>
<BR>
</p>The <b><u>Konami Code</u></b> is one of the most famous of these, and available in many video games made by Konami.  If the player moves their joystick up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, and then pressed button B followed by button A, the player will gain extra or unlimited power during the game.

<div title="Why do people play video games?">
  <div class="cld height3">
<span class="big"><p>For game developers, it is important to understand the types of games and game features will be successful with different audiences (kid, teen, adult, senior), in different markets (North America, Europe, Asia) and on different platforms (mobile, console, PC). The "type" of gamer is also important to know:</p>
<ul><li><b><u>Casual gamers</u></b> treat games as a way to pass time when they are bored.  These types of gamers often prefer games that are easy to learn and play, as well as games that give frequent feedback to the user or have levels that are easily attainable (positive feedback).</li><p>    
<li><b><u>Hardcore gamers</u></b> incorporate video games into their lifestyle.  These gamers often spend an exorbitant amount of time each day playing games.  As a result, they prefer challenging games that have a large amount of social interaction and depth.  These games often take a long time to achieve feedback or solve, and are amongst the most complex video games today. </li><p>
<li><b><u>Old school gamers</u></b> enjoy playing video games of previous generations, such as the 8-bit video games of the 1980s, such as <i>Galaga</i>, or the fighting games of the 1990s, such as <i>Street Fighter II</i>.  Like casual gamers, old school gamers usually don't spend a large amount of time playing games, and often prefer to play games with others in social settings or on mobile devices (e.g. the Atari game pack for iPad). </li><p>
<li><b><u>Competitive gamers</u></b> treat video games as a professional career for money, prizes and prestige.  Many of these gamers prefer games that involve rapid strategy or intense action gameplay.  South Korea has the largest professional competitive game industry in the world, with Starcraft being one of its most common competitive games.  Today, we often call this industry <b><u>electronic sports</u></b>.</li></ul>

<!-- Page 9 -->
<div title="Video game development teams">
  <div class="foo">
  <span class="big"><p>In the 1980s, video game development teams were fairly small - usually 1 or 2 people who performed all of the necessary roles themselves. In the 1990s, video game development teams became larger (6-10 people or more). Due to the flux in team sizes, video games since the 1990s have been classified as:</p>
<ul><li><b><u>AAA titles</u></b> (highest production value, budget, team size, and sales)</li>
<li><b><u>A titles</u></b> (major releases with high production value, budget and marketing)</li>
<li><b><u>B titles</u></b> (less glamorous production value, medium team size and budget)</li>
<li><b><u>C titles</u></b> (low production value, small team size, relatively cheap)</li></ul>
<BR>
</p>Currently, AAA video game development teams are much larger in size (sometimes involving hundreds of people) and consist of executive management, programming departments, artistic departments, music/audio departments, testing departments, and outsourced or 3rd party organizations. The development time for AAA titles today typically range from 24-48 months. </p>
<BR>
<p>However, smaller development teams (and timeline schedules) are frequent for other types of games that have proliferated over the past decade:</p>
<ul><li><b><u>Mobile games</u></b> typically take 4-8 months to develop</li>
<li><b><u>Social games</u></b> typically take 2-6 months to develop, and are usually developed frequently afterwards</li>
<li><b><u>Independent (Indie) games</u></b> take anywhere from 4 months to several years to develop, depending on the complexity and platform (e.g. Xbox 360) used</li>
</p></span>

<div title="Video game development steps">
  <div class="foo">
  <span class="big"><p>There are 9 phases in almost all video game development projects, regardless of their type and size:</p>
<BR>
<ol><li>1. <b><u>Concept development</u></b> - What game should we make?</li>
<BR>  
<li>2. <b><u>Preproduction</u></b> - Here is a prototype of the game that we think we should make.</li>
<BR>  
<li>3. <b><u>Development</u></b> - Let's make the game!</li>
<BR>  
<li>4. <b><u>Alpha</u></b> - The game is "mostly" playable from start to finish.  Now, let's put everything together!</li>
<BR>  
<li>5. <b><u>Beta</u></b> - The game is entirely playable.  Now, let's have people test the game and fix any bugs they find.</li>
<BR>  
<li>6. <b><u>Code freeze</u></b> - Let's do one final testing of the game to see if there are any major bugs we need to fix.</li>
<BR>  
<li>7. <b><u>Release to Manufacturing (RTM)</u></b> - The game is released to the publisher or online app store. Buy it!</li>
<BR>  
<li>8. <b><u>Patches</u></b> - These are bug fixes that are discovered and fixed after the game is released.</li>
<BR>  
<li>9. <b><u>Upgrades</u></b> - These are additional game features that enhance the game after it has been released.</li>
</p></span>

<div title="Video game developer roles">
  <div class="foo">
  <span class="big"><p>Most games today are envisioned and designed by game development veterans within the industry today, and are then developed by a team of talented people.  Although there are several different roles that people perform within a video game development team today, the five major roles that you will find today include:</p>
<BR>
<ul><li><b><u>Programmer</u></b> - These are the people that create the video game code itself using a programming language such as C++, or a scripting language such as Javascript.  There are typically more programmers on a video game team than any other role. </li>
<BR>
<li><b><u>Animator / Graphic Artist</u></b> - These are the people who create the graphical images (characters, landscapes, user interfaces) and animations used within the game. </li>
<BR>
<li><b><u>Sound Artist</u></b> - These are the people who create the sound effects and music used within the video game.</li>
<BR>
<li><b><u>Level Designer</u></b> - These are the people who design the levels and challenges within the game.</li>
<BR>
<li><b><u>Quality Assurance Tester</u></b> - These are the people who rigorously test parts of the video game during development and identify bugs within the code.</li>
</p>
