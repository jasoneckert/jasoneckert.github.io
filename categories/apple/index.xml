      <description>Janet Jackson might not be the first person who comes to mind when you think of a hacker. But she inadvertently created a malicious payload that performed a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on many different hard drive models manufactured in 2005 and later that rotated at a speed of 5400 rpm (rotations per minute).
How did it work? If your computer had a 5400 rpm hard drive, all you had to do was play Janet Jackson&amp;rsquo;s Rhythm Nation music video and it would unleash an acoustic resonance attack that damaged the hard drive.</description>
