                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="Body">As I was searching around my Facebook settings the other day, I noticed that there was a section that allows you to download your whole Facebook archive of posts and pictures.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">So I did that and noticed that I’ve posted some pretty funny stuff since I joined in 2007.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I really enjoy the humour I read from friend’s posts, and so I’ve always posted loads of it myself - Facebook is essentially the equivalent of reading the funny pages in the newspaper ;-).  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">While most of my posts are pictures (funny pictures, persona pictures, memes, etc.), I’ve also got lots of funny text posts.  I got a chuckle out of reading them again, so I thought I’d share them here for others to enjoy!<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Here they are, sorted from newest to oldest:<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">If you want to rapidly get through a crowded area, just carry a clipboard and try to make eye contact with people. People will give you space....fast ;-)<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Jeff: Our new IT guy moved here from Australia. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Me: Oh, really? <br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Jeff: Yeah, he comes from a LAN down under.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Went out and picked up some fried chicken. Thought it'd be the most appropriate food to eat while watching the US election ;-)<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Turned back the regular clocks 1 hour this morning. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body">My two binary clocks? Just had to turn them back a bit ;-)<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Cooking a Thanksgiving dinner is more about organizational skills than anything else. I've optimized the list of tasks and subtasks so that everything is done at exactly the same time with an offset of 15 seconds for each one to allow for easy transfer. This is why you need to have Microsoft Project loaded somewhere in your kitchen people!<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Tonight's WWITPRO was pretty neat - it was a sort of like a wine tasting party, but instead of wine, we passed around a ton of laptop models that Dell provided. &quot;This one has a nice carbon fibre texture and build quality, and the feint smell of a 6th gen i7&quot; ;-)<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I asked Siri, “Surely it isn’t going to rain tomorrow?” And she replied, “Yes it will, and don’t call me Shirley.”  Turns out I left Airplane mode on….<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I should open a bar that serves nothing but alcoholic apple cider drinks, and has free Wi-Fi. I could call it &quot;Ciderspace&quot; ;-)<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Every time I buy coffee grinds, they always make a big deal about the coffee being &quot;ethically sourced&quot; - I should open my own coffee company, where all of the coffee is &quot;un-ethically sourced&quot; - I could call it &quot;Bad Ass Coffee&quot; and make a fortune :D<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Today, I showed someone (not saying who) a job ad for a &quot;Senior Mobile Developer&quot; position. Their reaction was &quot;I'd love to apply for that job, but I'm not a senior.&quot; It took them a few seconds after my very obvious WTF expression to see what they misunderstood. I've never seen anyone turn that many shades of red before :D<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">OMG.....I couldn't take a pic of it because I was on the road, but I just saw the same model of car we had growing up pimped out on Hwy 24: a 1984 Plymouth Voyager minivan with a custom &quot;fire&quot; paintjob, intake vents and slim alloy wheels - and the seats inside were redone with red velvet. I'm so glad I wasn't drinking coffee or pop when I saw this or it'd be out my nose :D<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Deciding on a restaurant to go to for dinner is harder than nailing a jello to a tree.....suggestions anyone?<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Imagine going back in time and describing what a selfie is to someone in the 80s......<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">The US and Britain are in a competition to see who can mess themselves up the most. Currently Britain is in the lead, but the US has a Trump card up their sleeve....;-)<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">My grass is now 100% yellow and maintenance-free! <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Still at Hospital.... today is not a good day. I decided to go horseback riding - something I haven't done in forever. It turned out to be a big mistake! I got on the horse and started out slow, but then we went a little faster, and before I knew it we were going as fast as the horse could go. I couldn't take the pace and fell off but caught my foot in the stirrup with the horse dragging me. It wouldn't stop - it just kept going around and around in a circle. Thank goodness the store manager at Wal-Mart came out and unplugged the machine. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">The quickest way to turn a t-shirt into a fuzzy winter sweater is to wrestle with my dog for 5 minutes.....<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I live right behind a big park with a pro running track. Right now there are probably 50+ high schools competing there today, and their rest/water tents are set up all along the shaded areas amongst the trees right behind my back fence (about 6 feet from my picnic table). And in this heat, everyone looks tired. I just picked up some fresh KFC, and Pepper and I are eating it outside at my picnic table right now......slowly. About 4 tents down, I heard someone say &quot;Oh god, is that KFC?!? It's driving me nuts!&quot;.....hahaha :D<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">It was such a beautiful day out today, I did something I haven't done for years... I played a round of golf. Sure, it was Wii golf......but still.....<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">There was an email I had to respond to that I just couldn't word properly. After having a coffee, I worded it effortlessly and perfectly. Coffee works people!<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I'm pleasantly surprised that there is a place in Harlem, NYC called &quot;Harlem Shake&quot; that serves burger and shakes ;-)<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">The new ordering kiosks at McDonalds are pretty cool. Firstly, they don't mess up your order......secondly, you can totally customize everything - so I investigated, and found that it lets you order up to 10 patties on a Big Mac!<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">HTTP 200 jokes are OK......<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Was digging through the middle compartment in the car and pulled out a zipper case full of music CDs......from way back when we didn't listen to the songs on our phone via Bluetooth in our cars. Popped one in the CD player and listened one heck of an odd assortment of awesome tunes.......it was sort of like &quot;car archaeology&quot; :D<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Am I the only one who thinks Kathleen Wynne looks like Humpty Dumpty from Digital Underground?<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Yup......like that great song &quot;American Frisbee&quot; by Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young ;-)<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I've never heard so many David Bowie songs on the radio - it's like every radio station is playing them all day long......if Justin Bieber dies, I'm not turning on the radio at all.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Whoever put the &quot;b&quot; in the word &quot;subtle&quot; was a clever bastard.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I just bought myself a ton of new socks tonight. In retrospect, it's probably the best gift I could give my dog for Christmas ;-)<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I just used the phrase &quot;Cheer up dude....it's Whopper Wednesday!&quot;, and it worked as expected ;-)<br /></p>

                <p class="Body">What happens in Vegas doesn't happen to me.....<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Not to brag, but I can almost always tell if they're using fake dinosaurs in a movie.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I bet the YMCA dance is way harder to do in Japanese....<br /></p>

                <p class="Body">There is a point in every man's life where you find yourself standing outside a pizza parlour at 1:00am with 2 other guys unloading 4 arcade machines from a pickup truck ;-)<br /></p>

You'll have to drive around in his 2012 Mercedes-Benz CL, and he will supply all of your clothes.&quot; &quot;Because of The long hours, meals will be provided.

                <p class="Body">From Doug Weatherby: The Big Bang Starts the Universe Out in the Most Metal Way Possible ~14 billion years ago Once upon a time, our universe was condensed into a point smaller than a single atom, which sounds super cute but actually was quite volatile. It suddenly burst, giving birth to both time and space. After just 100 seconds, it was trillions of miles across. Innumerable elementary subatomic particles were crashing into one another, with antimatter destroying matter. Hydrogen gas formed, and collapsed by gravity into itself until pressure grew so immense that those hydrogen atoms fused into helium. So stars were born, fusing atoms into ever more complex elements until the stars began creating iron, at which point they collapsed into themselves and exploded into supernovas ñ unimaginably powerful detonations that in an instant formed all of the other elements that make up our world. So every atom in your body was born in a star. You are, technically, a star. Except you, Miley Cyrus.<br /></p>

Turns out, doors themselves are to blame for these strange memory lapses. Psychologists at the University of Notre Dame have discovered that passing through a doorway triggers what's known as an event boundary in the mind, separating one set of thoughts and memories from the next. Your brain files away the thoughts you had in the previous room and prepares a blank slate for the new locale. It's not aging, it's the door! Thank goodness for studies like this. Actually, that's all bullshit. You probably have Alzheimer's.<br /></p>

I've held off on getting Mists of Pandaria because I got burned out on endgame progression after Wrath of the Lich King and the Cataclysm content is still new to me. Plus monks seem redundant in an era of dual specialization and viable hybrid DPS, and while I know they're well-established in the lore, Pandaren don't appeal to me. So I'm wrapping up a Taunka questline in the Borean Tundra, trying to determine if I should go to Dragonblight or Grizzly Hills.......and now you know how I feel when you won't shut up about sports!<br /></p>

                <p class="Body">I honestly can't believe how lame this is, but it is true - I threw my back out tonight playing Angry Birds.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Just putting the finishing touches this week on my Playbook app for the BlackBerry Partner's Fund Challenge - it's called &quot;Reverse Zombify&quot; - you actually have to turn people into zombies in strategic ways to earn points. And if you get all of the Village People, you earn 1000 bonus points. If you get all the members of the A Team, you get 5000 bonus points.<br /></p>

                <p class="Body">Saw a great t-shirt yesterday in a store on Charles St in Kitchener - it read &quot;Nothing is Bitchener than Kitchener&quot; and had a picture of Lord Kitchener on it.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Creating course materials is such a boring job - it is basically transporting large amounts of caffeine from the coffee maker to the toilette. At least I'm good at it.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">While standing in line at Tim Hortons, I really don't think it is offensive to let the person in front of you know that they typed &quot;confidential&quot; wrong on their BlackBerry. Apparently, others disagree.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Another social networking event tonight......ahhhhh! I'm really starting to hate smiling and making polite chit-chat.....it just isn't me.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Starting to come down off of the Red Bull high from the last 2 days. I don't remember how many I drank, but it was a lot. I don't think I could have stayed awake during The Great Canadian Appathon without it though....<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">My new years resolution is to have more patience for people who call flash/disk storage &quot;memory&quot;<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">You can have a lot of fun today because the malls are so crowded - just go to the mall, but not to shop.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I just realized something - that new BlackBerry Playbook RIM is coming out with basically runs the same OS that those old ICON computers did back in high school (QNX) - I have good memories of getting banned from the ICON lab at GCI for breaking into the LexICON file server.......about 4 times I think.....<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I am giving two presentations at this year's Microsoft Virtual Summit.......and I've spent all day trying to come up with content for it.......ended up with nothing......I think my brain had a &quot;blue screen of death&quot;<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I have now officially found my Starbucks limit - 7 Venti Bolds per day. It was really freakin' hard to type this.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">A girlfriend is no substitute for video games....<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I just perfected the art of snowblowing. Only took 7 years.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="Body">I realized today that the reason why I order out when I have friends over (like tonight and the last dozen times) is because I don't cook (out of common courtesy for others).</p>
