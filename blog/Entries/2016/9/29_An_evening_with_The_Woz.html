              <div class="style">
                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="Body"><span class="style_1">Steve Wozniak</span> (a.k.a. The Woz) was one of the keynote speakers at yesterday’s <span class="style_1">Fuzenation Technology &amp; Music Summit </span>in Kitchener, Ontario.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">For those who don’t know who the Woz is, Google his name!<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">In short, he’s the <span class="style_1">co-founder of Apple</span>, and the engineer who created the Apple I and Apple II computers.  The Apple II was the first successful, mass-produced personal computer, and as the Woz points out, the “first one that could play arcade games in full color” (I still have an Apple II that I use to play arcade games like Donkey Kong).<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">More importantly, most people in technology fields view the Woz as a <span class="style_1">role model</span> (myself included).  He is a talented engineer, creative thinker, prolific teacher, playful jokester, and wonderful person with strong moral values.  In other words, he is what we all want to be.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">So, when I found out that he was talking only 15 minutes away from my house, I had to go.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I always go to events an hour early.  One reason for this is to get a good seat where I can see everything, but I also like to observe the other people that pour into the event. There were people from all walks of life!  There was an old guy in a suit carrying an original Mac 128K computer (I wonder if he realized that the Woz had nothing to do with the creation of the Mac ;-), as well as hipsters, creative startup vultures with crazed expressions on their faces, rich trendy people, people who were brave enough to venture out of their parent’s basements, young brats, and so on.  It was glorious for a people watcher like me.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Woz’s introduction was this video: <a title="https://youtu.be/AWQKNxuGqg4?list=RDAWQKNxuGqg4" href="https://youtu.be/AWQKNxuGqg4?list=RDAWQKNxuGqg4">https://youtu.be/AWQKNxuGqg4?list=RDAWQKNxuGqg4</a> that showcased the <span class="style_1">1982 US Festival</span> (a massive music festival that the Woz put on because “he could and no one else would”).<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">After the video, he came on stage to a big round of applause, and within seconds you realize that you can’t help but like the guy.  His body language and spoken language are 100% genuine, and like many people who actively think on the fly, he talks fast.  He answers questions without pausing to think, and his replies seem to start off-topic, but beautifully coalesce into a solid and satisfying answer or story (much like a good joke).<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Woz said that he always wanted to be an engineer and a 5th grade teacher.  After Apple, he taught for 8 years straight as a volunteer teacher, and wrote all of his own lesson plans for each class.  His teaching experience showed during the talk - when he responded to questions, he simplified nearly every topic to a level that anyone could understand.  This is a trait that I'm good at as a teacher (students always want to be in my class), and a skill I can quickly pick out in other people.  It takes time, creativity and practice to do it well, and the Woz does it well.  The only downside is that, with him talking fast, I imagine it was a bit of information overload for those in the audience who weren’t technically inclined ;-)<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Although much of the information and stories that Woz shared at the event were also in his 2006 autobiography <span class="style_1">iWoz</span> (<a title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWoz" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWoz">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWoz</a>), it was much nicer to hear them in person, and often with a different spin.  Here are some snippets that I specifically recall from last night’s talk:<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
