                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Linux has a very colorful history if you go back far enough - it is essentially a by-product of an evolutionary process that started back in the early days of computer science that led to the creation of <span class="style_1">mainframes</span>, <span class="style_1">UNIX</span>, <span class="style_1">FSF</span>, <span class="style_1">GNU</span> and the <span class="style_1">GPL</span>.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body">  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Back in the post-war 1940s, companies were getting bigger than ever before.  And this caused a headache for their accounting departments that had to hire more and more people to crunch the numbers on fancy adding machines:<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 458px; width: 610px;  height: 458px; position: relative; width: 610px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_3 inline-block stroke_1"><img src="2_A_brief_history_of_Linux_and_Open_Source_files/droppedImage_1.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 458px; width: 611px; " /></div><br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">In short, business needed computers to solve their accounting problems - and computer science was founded to fill this need.  So the companies that made these adding machines started producing <span class="style_1">mainframe computers</span> in the 1950s to crunch the financial numbers.  One of the most common mainframe manufacturers was <span class="style_1">International Business Machines (IBM)</span> - the same company that made the adding machines used in businesses ;-)<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 479px; width: 610px;  height: 479px; position: relative; width: 610px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_3 inline-block stroke_2"><img src="2_A_brief_history_of_Linux_and_Open_Source_files/droppedImage_2.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 479px; width: 611px; " /></div><br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Mainframe computing was slow and expensive, and when you wrote a program to run on a mainframe, it wasn’t compatible with other mainframes made by different manufacturers (this is called <span class="style_1">portability</span> in computing).  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">So, in the 1960s, a bunch of mainframe computer companies got together and funded a joint project called <span class="style_1">MULTICS (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service)</span> that aimed to create a standard operating system that would allow people to run more things on a mainframe at once.  It was too optimistic, and ultimately a complete failure.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">However, the failure of MULTICS wasn’t the end - it inspired two computer scientists at AT&amp;T Bell Labs (Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie) to carry on the MULTICS project in 1969.....but in a single direction.  They came up with an operating system they called <span class="style_1">UNICS</span> (UNI = one direction).  UNICS was rewritten in Dennis Ritchie’s new portable computer language called <span class="style_1">C</span> and renamed <span class="style_1">UNIX</span>.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 377px; width: 610px;  height: 377px; position: relative; width: 610px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_3 inline-block stroke_3"><img src="2_A_brief_history_of_Linux_and_Open_Source_files/droppedImage_3.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 377px; width: 611px; " /></div><br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">UNIX was the first serious development of a portable, multitasking, application-oriented operating system.  However, AT&amp;T was restricted by a federal court order at the time preventing them from marketing UNIX.  As a result, AT&amp;T instead sold the UNIX source code off to several companies, which developed their own <span class="style_1">flavors</span> of UNIX, as well as gave free copies out to several universities including the University of California at Berkeley from which we have BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) UNIX.  UNIX ruled the corporate computing world in the 1970s and 1980s, with each vendor further developing their own flavor of UNIX:<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 422px; width: 610px;  height: 422px; position: relative; width: 610px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_4 inline-block stroke_4 shadow_0"><img src="2_A_brief_history_of_Linux_and_Open_Source_files/droppedImage_4.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 423px; width: 611px; " /></div><br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Unfortunately, UNIX companies didn’t like to work together to further the development of UNIX since it was less profitable to do so.  Companies at the time favored proprietary technologies that forced customers to buy more from a single vendor, often for very high prices.  This UNIX fragmentation and commercialization was something that bothered <span class="style_1">Richard Stallman</span>:<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">  <br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 342px; width: 610px;  height: 342px; position: relative; width: 610px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_4 inline-block stroke_5 shadow_1"><img src="2_A_brief_history_of_Linux_and_Open_Source_files/droppedImage_5.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 342px; width: 611px; " /></div><br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">As a result, Stallman started the <span class="style_1">Free Software Foundation (FSF)</span> in 1985 to encourage computer science students and freelance software programmers worldwide to develop free software for the UNIX platform.  Richard had seen success as a result of collaboration between software developers in the Artificial Intelligence Labs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) earlier and believed that the sharing of ideas would result in faster software development.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Stallman also started the <span class="style_1">GNU Project</span>, which aimed to create a free UNIX-like operating system (GNU stands for <span class="style_1">G</span>NUs <span class="style_1">N</span>ot <span class="style_1">U</span>NIX).    Unfortunately, the GNU Project never came to fruition during the 1980s, because much like MULTICS, it was too ambitious.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 210px; width: 210px;  clear: left; float: left; height: 210px; margin: 12px 12px 12px 0px; position: relative; width: 210px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_5 inline-block"><img src="2_A_brief_history_of_Linux_and_Open_Source_files/droppedImage.png" alt="" style="border: none; height: 210px; width: 210px; " /></div>By the late 1980s, however, the GNU Project led to the release of the <span class="style_1">GNU Public License (GPL)</span>.  The GPL was a legalization of free software; it stated that anyone who develops software and publishes it under the GPL must make the source code for the program freely accessible to anyone who wishes to have it.  Anyone who modifies the source code to make the program better must then redistribute his or her modified source code freely in return, keeping the software free forever.  Consequently, the GPL is often called <span class="style_1">copyleft</span> to distinguish it from copyright ;-)<br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 255px; width: 198px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 255px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 12px; position: relative; width: 198px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_6 inline-block stroke_6 shadow_2"><img src="2_A_brief_history_of_Linux_and_Open_Source_files/droppedImage_6.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 255px; width: 199px; " /></div><br /></div>
                <p class="Body">In 1991, a Finnish student named <span class="style_1">Linus Torvalds</span> created an improved version of <span class="style_1">MINIX</span> that others affectionately called <span class="style_1">Linux</span>.  MINIX (mini UNIX) was a small UNIX for the Intel x86 platform that shipped with Andrew Tannenbaum's book &quot;Operating Systems Design &amp; Implementation&quot; used in Universities worldwide.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">The most important feature of Linux at the time was that it was released under the GPL.  With a free operating system to develop, programmers worldwide pooled their talent in great numbers.  Free software development became incredibly popular, but many people didn’t realize that “free” meant that the source code was freely available (the product didn’t necessary have to be free of charge).  As a result, a better term was created to refer to free software: <span class="style_1">open source software</span>.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Because it was open source, Linux development grew steadily during the early 1990s, but it still wasn’t anything close to a mature operating system.  In fact, installing Linux in the early 1990s was like nailing Jello to a tree.......for masochists only!  It wasn’t until Red Hat Linux was released in 1995 that installing Linux became relatively easy.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">So what is Red Hat Linux?  Well, it’s one of the earliest <span class="style_1">distributions</span> of Linux.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">To understand what a Linux distribution is, you have to first understand how Linux and open source software were developed in the 1990s.  Although the 1990s Internet allowed for worldwide collaboration, it was still much easier to develop software with people that lived close to you.  As a result, Linux and open source software were developed differently in different areas of the world.  Linus Torvalds and his team developed the Linux operating system kernel and libraries, and developers worldwide developed the open source software packages that could be packaged with it.  You could obtain different distributions (or <span class="style_1">distros</span>) of Linux as a result.  All Linux distros share the same kernel and libraries, yet may have different open source software packages that tie it all together.  And these open source software packages were often developed in a certain part of the world.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Since the release of the Red Hat Linux distribution, hundreds of other Linux distributions started popping up - some common ones today include: <br /></p>

                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">In 1998, Red Hat reported that there were over <span class="style_1">750,000 installs</span> of their Linux distribution.  And as the Internet grew exponentially in the late 1990s, Linux became popular free OS for running Web servers (using the open source <span class="style_1">Apache Web server</span>), and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) starting using it exclusively for Web and email servers.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">This Linux momentum was so great, that the <span class="style_1">big companies</span> (IBM, Compaq, HP, Dell, etc.) started pushing Linux on the server end.  In 2001, IBM gave away <span class="style_1">$1 Billion</span> to open source developers to further Linux development (just imagine how much more revenue they made as a direct result of Linux).  To give you an idea of how big Linux was to IBM, check out this Linux commercial from 2000: <a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJA9eiUktcA" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJA9eiUktcA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJA9eiUktcA</a><br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">It’s not hard to understand why companies find Linux and other open source software sexy compared to proprietary (closed source) software.  The biggest fear that a company has is that its proprietary software will cease to be supported by the software vendor - with open source software, you have the source code, and can continue developing a product internally forever, even if other outside developers decide not to. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Moreover, open source software is collaboratively developed and scrutinized by thousands of developers; <span class="style_1">bugs and security loopholes are fixed quickly</span>.  Since those who ultimately use open source software are those who contribute to its development, it is also <span class="style_1">maintained and improved at a very fast rate</span> compared to proprietary software.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Because Linux is open source, it can also be easily <span class="style_1">tailored for any use</span>. Highly customized Linux distributions are very common in embedded devices and portable systems such as GPSes, traffic light controls, in-car systems, home appliances, sound/video production hardware, and more. Google <span class="style_1">Android</span>, which runs on hundreds of millions of smartphones, tablets and devices today, is also a Linux distribution!  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>

In March 2014, Ubuntu Linux boasted that more than 22 million users used their distro alone.<br /></p>
