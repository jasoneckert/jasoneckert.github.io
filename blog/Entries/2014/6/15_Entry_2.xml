    <richText>&lt;b&gt;This post is a departure from my typical tech-oriented material.&#xD;&#xD;Les Mis&#xE9;rables is my favorite musical - when I was in high school, it was the focus of our performances for my senior two years, and I&#x2019;ve loved it ever since.&#xA0; I was the pianist for our band groups and know every song by heart.&#xD;&#xD;Recently, when my daughter backed out of a free ticket to the premiere of Les Mis&#xE9;rables&#xD;at the Dunfield Theatre in Cambridge, I took her place.&#xA0; The performance was perhaps the best I&#x2019;ve seen.....ever!&#xA0; And I&#x2019;ve seen plenty of musicals ;-)&#xD;&#xD;Of course, that led me to Google for some academic pursuits, and I immediately noticed there was a Les Mis&#xE9;rables movie released in 2012 starring Hugh Jackman, and decided to watch it.&#xA0; To say that the movie was disappointing would be an understatement.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The biggest problem with this film is that it suffers from identity crisis.&#xA0;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; It doesn&#x2019;t know if it&#x2019;s a movie or a musical.....and this confusion lasts throughout.&#xA0; Both the story and emotional impact is lost as a result.&#xA0; The movie is performed and sung like a musical, but with the closeups and scenery panning of a movie.&#xA0; Many parts are over-acted, slow-paced, too serious, and poorly fitted to the story.&#xA0; The WOW factor that you get in the musical is gone.&#xD;&#xD;When I was a kid, I watched The Pirates of Penzance musical on TV, and it was great!&#xA0; It wasn&#x2019;t ultra-realistic and was filmed in a way that made you feel as if you were in a theatre watching a musical.&#xA0; As a result, you were able to focus on the acting and music just like at a live musical.&#xA0; I still remember the part where the flowers were singing - a crude stage effect, but hilarious!&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;However, the producers of the Les Mis&#xE9;rables movie thought they needed to add more than just the stage dimension, and it didn&#x2019;t work.&#xA0; Don&#x2019;t get me wrong here - I think that Les Mis&#xE9;rables would make an excellent movie!&#xA0; An incredible movie, even!&#xA0; But it has to be a movie - no singing!&#xA0; Of course, the famous music could still be incorporated into a movie, and key parts could have a song incorporated into it.&#xA0; But keep it a movie. And get Quentin Tarantino to direct it ;-)&#xD;&#xD;One of the biggest strengths of the Les Mis&#xE9;rables musical is that it is perfectly fitted to the musical medium, and this allows it to stir emotion throughout.&#xA0; Movies can do that as well, but the dialog must be changed to fit the medium - in other words, Les Mis&#xE9;rables would need to be adapted to a movie format to be an effective and stirring movie.&#xD;&#xD;Unfortunately, the producers of the 2012 movie pumped out a movie-like musical film that was horrific at best.&#xA0; I wouldn&#x2019;t recommend it to anyone, regardless of whether they have seen the Les Mis&#xE9;rables musical before. Instead, just go out and see the musical and enjoy the story in a way that it was meant to be portrayed!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
