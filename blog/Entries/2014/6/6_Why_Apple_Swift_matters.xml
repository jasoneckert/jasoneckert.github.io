    <richText>&lt;b&gt;This past week Apple announced a new programming language called &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Swift&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, that they&#x2019;ve created to replace their existing Objective-C language.&#xA0; For app developers, it was an epic announcement - everyone in our developer faculties talked about it on our calls that week and I received at least a few dozen Swift-related emails each day during the week from my developer friends. &#xD;&#xD;But for everyone else, Apple&#x2019;s announcement of Swift was just plain boring - they would rather have heard about a new iDevice of some type.&#xA0;&#xA0; However, non-developers should be as excited about Apple&#x2019;s new Swift language as developers are, and in this post I&#x2019;m going to tell you why.&#xD;&#xD;Firstly, a programming language is simply an abstract language that follows some set rules and allows you to interface with a plethora of build-in functions for a specific computing device platform (in this case, the Apple iPhone, iPad, iMac, and so on).&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Secondly, the whole purpose of development is to create apps, and apps can be created easier and faster if the developer toolset used:&#xD;&#x2022; Is easy to work with&#x2028;&#x2022; Has more functionality&#x2028;&#xD;In recent years, programming languages that use simple syntax and whitespace have been gaining traction as a result of their simplicity.&#xA0; These languages are easier to write, easier for others to read, and this ultimately means that apps can be made quicker and with fewer human mistakes.&#xA0; Swift definitely falls into this category when compared with Objective-C.&#xA0; For example, to create a string of text that can be used within other parts of the program (e.g. to display the words &#x201C;Hello World&#x201C;), you had to create an NSString (NeXT Software String) object that held the letters &#x201C;Hello&#x201D;, and then append a space and the letters &#x201C;World&#x201D; afterwards:&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;NSString *str = @"Hello,"; &#xD;str = [str stringByAppendingString:@" World"];&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;However, in Swift, you could simply create a string variable that held the letters &#x201C;Hello&#x201D; and use the concatenation operator (+) to append a space and the letters &#x201C;World&#x201D;:&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;var str = "Hello,"; &#xD;str += " World"&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;Which language would you prefer to code in?&#xA0; I guessing you chose the easier one...&#xD;&#xD;When it comes to functionality, imagine that the programming language you have comes with an easy-to-use built in function that can be used to draw a 3D cube.&#xA0; You can type a single line of code that uses that function with the parameters that you specify.&#xA0; Now imagine that your language had no such 3D cube function, but instead has a line drawing function.&#xA0; You would need to write a tremendous amount of code just to draw the cube using lines that make it appear 3D, and in a way that can be modified if the cube is moved or rotated.&#xA0; Not fun.&#xA0; Groups of key functions, like the 3D cube one we talked about, are often called &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, and Apple has made over 4000 new APIs available for Apple devices, including one called &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, that makes it much easier to create 3D games for iOS!&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;In short, by announcing a series of APIs that make it easier to develop apps, and a new programming language that is easier to work with, Apple hasn&#x2019;t just made the lives of developers easier - they&#x2019;ve made it easier to create more and better apps that can do more than the apps we have today, as well as encourage more people to enter the app developer profession. And this is why everyone should be excited about Apple&#x2019;s announcements this past week - expect to see some amazing apps soon!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
