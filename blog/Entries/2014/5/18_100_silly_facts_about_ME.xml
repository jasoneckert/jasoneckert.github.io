    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Although I don&#x2019;t watch television, I&#x2019;ve been watching the episodes of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Goldbergs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;online because it&#x2019;s absolutely hilarious and I relate to a lot of the stuff in it from my own childhood experiences.&#xA0; The final episode of season 1 was this week, and it starts off by talking about how the father never bragged about past events (no matter how cool), and would occasionally say something that totally made you think you knew nothing about him ;-)&#xD;&#xD;I&#x2019;m definitely guilty of that too, so it inspired me to do this fun post.&#xA0; Enjoy!&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Without further ado.....here are 100 fun facts about me:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;1. I had an old &#x201C;brick&#x201D; cell phone when I was a teenager that only cost me the $12/month network fee.&#xA0; All my airtime was free because I would call in fake accidents and slowdowns to CHYM FM (they gave you 100 free minutes on the Bell network if you called in an accident/slowdown).&#x2028;&#xD;2. I married the girl I had a crush on in high school. Before we were engaged, we camped in a tent and had a farting contest, which she won. &#x2028;&#xD;3. I&#x2019;m naturally gifted at the game of golf - I don&#x2019;t practice at all, but can kick your ass.&#x2028;&#xD;4. I had a paper route when I was a kid (a free newspaper called The Pennysaver), but instead of delivering them, I dumped them in an overgrown field each week, and spent any money I made on pop, chips, and arcade games.&#xA0; It took them over a year to figure it out, at which point I politely resigned.&#x2028;&#xD;5. I started going to university when I was still in high school as part of an Advanced Placement program - I spent most of my time doing programming and financial research for the University of Waterloo School of Accounting and explored the rest of the university in my spare time.&#x2028;&#xD;6. I totaled my dad&#x2019;s minivan in an accident.&#xA0; Upon finding out, his first words were &#x201C;But I had a case of beer in the back!&#x201D;&#x2028;&#xD;7.

I almost hit a bear that ran across the road in front of my car when driving in Algonquin park near dusk.&#x2028;&#xD;12.

I&#x2019;m the first person to get 99,999,999 (the highest score) on the arcade game RAIDEN.&#x2028;&#xD;14.

I played a TON of Atari 2600 games when I was a kid.&#xA0; My favorite games were Berzerk and Yars Revenge.&#xA0; When the Nintendo NES came out, the Atari was forgotten, and I spent my time completing all of the Super Mario and Zelda games.&#xA0; I still have an original NES in my living room connected to my TV.&#x2028;&#xD;17. My parents bought me a Cabbage Patch Doll when I was a kid.&#xA0; Shortly after, I gave it to my sister.&#x2028;&#xD;18.

I got to meet several famous people over the years, including Glenn T.

The only alcoholic drink that I really like is Guinness.&#x2028;&#xD;32. I published a mobile app that allows you to track bullshit words that you hear in meetings (action item, synergy, customer centric, etc.) and compare the total bullshit for your meeting to past meetings.&#xA0; It is crazy popular.&#x2028;&#xD;33. Compaq once drop-shipped over $300,000 worth of DEC Alpha computers to my campus for me to do research on.&#xA0; I still have one of them.&#x2028;&#xD;34. I helped design and implement one of the largest parallel computing clusters in Canada by coding the MPICH implementation.&#x2028;&#xD;35.

I played on a baseball team briefly growing up.&#xA0; The house I live in today backs onto the field that I used to play baseball in.&#x2028;&#xD;45. I got into a school fight in Gr.8 and broke another kids nose.&#xA0; I still feel bad about that.&#xA0; But not as bad as the kid who I accidentally hit in the balls with a baseball when he pitched me a low shot.&#xA0; They had to take him to the hospital.&#xA0; I wonder if he can have kids.....&#x2028;&#xD;46. My first &#x201C;real&#x201D; job was at KFC when I was 14 years old.&#xA0; I got the job without an interview because my grandfather knew the owner.&#x2028;&#xD;47.

I was once offered an incredibly lucrative job in the middle east training people on Linux for a large gas company.&#xA0; The only catch was that I&#x2019;d have to be smuggled in through Germany, there were no indoor toilettes, and I&#x2019;d be close to a war zone.&#xA0; I turned it down ;-)&#x2028;&#xD;52.&#xA0; I once carried a table home on my head in the rain.&#x2028;&#xD;53.
