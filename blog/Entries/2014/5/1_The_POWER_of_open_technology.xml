    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Wired recently published a great article detailing how Google is looking at using non-Intel CPUs (more specifically POWER8 CPUs from IBM) for their compute nodes: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/04/openpower"&gt;http://www.wired.com/2014/04/openpower&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&#xD;The entire article can be summed up with this one quote from the article: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The difference with ARM and Power is that any outside manufacturers can license the designs and modify them as need be. That&#x2019;s not the case with Intel&#x2019;s x86 architecture. The onus is on Intel to innovate.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;Let me explain this statement in more depth using mobile devices as an example.&#xA0;&#xA0; Have you ever wondered why the small amount of circuitry inside your smartphone or iPad can do so much processing?&#xA0;&#xA0; The reason you wonder this is because you are used to your desktop computer taking up an incredible amount of space and consisting of several components - the more powerful each component (CPU, video card, hard drive, etc.), the faster your computer, and the more it can do.&#xD;&#xD;The problem with the mobile space is that this desktop computer strategy just can&#x2019;t work.&#xA0; As a result, nearly all mobile devices (like your Android smartphone or Apple iPad) use ARM CPUs.&#xA0; More specifically, they use &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;customized ARM CPUs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;that are designed to do the sort of stuff you&#x2019;d normally do on a phone really really well.&#xA0; And they often have even more customization that allows them to work very closely with graphics functions, RAM and storage - the closer you put these together, the smaller and faster your ARM CPU can be.&#xA0; Eventually, there may only be one chip inside your phone that has integrated CPU, RAM, storage and video functionality!&#xD;&#xD;Why is this possible?&#xA0; Because &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARM is an open design&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; - manufacturers such as Samsung and Apple can license it and modify it to suit their needs!&#xA0;&#xA0; Apple started doing this with the A4 chip (a heavily customized ARM CPU with an integrated PowerVR graphics processor).&#xA0;&#xA0; By controlling the hardware, you can put specific &#x201C;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;hooks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#x201D; in your CPU and associated operating system software to work together in faster ways.&#xA0; If you&#x2019;ve ever used a newer iPad, you&#x2019;ll understand why Apple chose the custom route - it allowed them to marry their hardware and software together to perform much better!&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;POWER is also an open design&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; - Google could license it and customize it to suit their specialized needs.&#xA0; They could then marry their hardware and software together in a way that they could never do by using a stock Intel CPU and fitting their software to it.&#xA0;&#xA0; From the Wired article, it looks like they&#x2019;re &#x201C;hooked&#x201D; on the idea (pun intended).&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open technologies foster innovation because they are open to allowing modification. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Knowing the incredible advances in mobile technology over the past decade that were made possible by the open ARM platform, just imagine what Google could do with their server farms if they adopted an open processing platform like POWER8!&#xA0;&#xA0; And it&#x2019;s just a matter of time before desktop, laptop, and server hardware manufacturers follow suit.&#xA0; If Intel remains a closed design, they will essentially open up the market to all sorts of competitors in the CPU space!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
