                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I’m definitely guilty of that too, so it inspired me to do this fun post.  Enjoy!<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Without further ado.....here are 100 fun facts about me:<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">1. I had an old “brick” cell phone when I was a teenager that only cost me the $12/month network fee.  All my airtime was free because I would call in fake accidents and slowdowns to CHYM FM (they gave you 100 free minutes on the Bell network if you called in an accident/slowdown).<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">2. I married the girl I had a crush on in high school. Before we were engaged, we camped in a tent and had a farting contest, which she won. <br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">3. I’m naturally gifted at the game of golf - I don’t practice at all, but can kick your ass.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">4. I had a paper route when I was a kid (a free newspaper called The Pennysaver), but instead of delivering them, I dumped them in an overgrown field each week, and spent any money I made on pop, chips, and arcade games.  It took them over a year to figure it out, at which point I politely resigned.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">5. I started going to university when I was still in high school as part of an Advanced Placement program - I spent most of my time doing programming and financial research for the University of Waterloo School of Accounting and explored the rest of the university in my spare time.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">6. I totaled my dad’s minivan in an accident.  Upon finding out, his first words were “But I had a case of beer in the back!”<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">7. The coffee table in my rec room is an old IBM 3380 hard drive that used to be in the famous “Red Room” at the University of Waterloo.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">8. I helped write a professor’s textbook for Nuclear Chemistry while I was still a Science undergrad.  I was also the Teaching Assistant (TA) for his Nuclear Chemistry course.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">9. I was the web master for the University of Waterloo Faculty of Science for 8 months.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">10.

                <p class="Body">11. I almost hit a bear that ran across the road in front of my car when driving in Algonquin park near dusk.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">12. My favorite arcade game when I was a kid was Missile Command.  Today, I actually own a full-sized Missile Command arcade machine in my basement.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">13. I’m the first person to get 99,999,999 (the highest score) on the arcade game RAIDEN.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">14. I really like calculus.  In first year university, after my prof told me that she has never handed out a higher calculus grade in her years of teaching, I considering switching to the Faculty of Math but decided against it. <br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">15. I have a UNIX tattoo, and my license plate is UNIXGURU.  My favorite types of UNIX are SGI IRIX and Mac OSX.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">16. I played a TON of Atari 2600 games when I was a kid.  My favorite games were Berzerk and Yars Revenge.  When the Nintendo NES came out, the Atari was forgotten, and I spent my time completing all of the Super Mario and Zelda games.  I still have an original NES in my living room connected to my TV.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">17. My parents bought me a Cabbage Patch Doll when I was a kid.  Shortly after, I gave it to my sister.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">18. I’m very good at drawing.  I won several drawing contests growing up, which scored me several prizes including a neon orange skateboard, a Sony Walkman, and a CD player.  I was the first person I knew who actually had a CD player (this was 1985 and they were stupidly expensive), and the first CD I bought was the first Weird Al album.<br /><br /></p>

                <p class="Body">26. I once scored a programming job only because I liked Hawaiian Pizza (they program as a group, and don’t like to order something different for new team members).<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">27. I can get over 1,000.000 points on the arcade game Galaga on any difficulty level.  I play Galaga many times per week still today.<br /><br /></p>

                <p class="Body">32. I published a mobile app that allows you to track bullshit words that you hear in meetings (action item, synergy, customer centric, etc.) and compare the total bullshit for your meeting to past meetings.  It is crazy popular.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">33. Compaq once drop-shipped over $300,000 worth of DEC Alpha computers to my campus for me to do research on.  I still have one of them.<br /><br /></p>

                <p class="Body">45. I got into a school fight in Gr.8 and broke another kids nose.  I still feel bad about that.  But not as bad as the kid who I accidentally hit in the balls with a baseball when he pitched me a low shot.  They had to take him to the hospital.  I wonder if he can have kids.....<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">46. My first “real” job was at KFC when I was 14 years old.  I got the job without an interview because my grandfather knew the owner.<br /><br /></p>

                <p class="Body">58.  I have a plethora of video game themed art around my house.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">59. When my daughter and I went to Disney World, we saw the aftermath of a shooting at the bus stop in Downtown Disney.  I got in trouble from the Deputy Sheriff of Orange County for taking a picture.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">60. I have 15 different arcade machines in my house.  I prefer to play arcade games to most games that are popular today.  And I know how to repair them too (including the circuit boards).<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">61. I used to rollerblade all over Waterloo when I was a student.  I even used to push my daughter’s stroller around on rollerblades (really fast, because she liked the thrill).<br /><br /></p>

I hosted the first Linux Expo in Canada.  It was small, and hosted at our Kitchener campus, but we had a great turnout and some great speakers.  This was before the dotcom boom, around the time that people were starting to realize that Linux was cool.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">76. I’m an incredibly organized person, and I worry about the stupidest things.....just like my grandfather!  My middle name is also my grandfathers first name.<br /><br /></p>
