    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Polybius was a fun urban legend during the days of arcade game culture that is still referenced today in pop culture.&#xA0; Read my earlier blog post if you want to know more about it &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/40EE3F4E-73ED-4E26-9DBA-2832FEDF500D"&gt;&lt;Click Here&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xD;&#xD;A lot of arcade game collectors have made mockup Polybius cabinets for fun (usually with a multi-game board in it or MAME).&#xA0; For me, I just wanted another arcade cabinet that I could put my Arkanoid Revenge of DOH board into.&#xA0; Since I was a kid, I&#x2019;ve always wanted to beat DOH (the boss at the end of the game, who is also shown in the picture at the top of this post).&#xA0; But in order to do so, you&#x2019;d need an insane amount of quarters because the game is a frustrating quarter sucker!&#xA0; As a result, I think Arkanoid Revenge of DOH gave kids more nightmares than Polybius ever would, so I decided to ensure that the cabinet had a Polybius theme.&#xD;&#xD;What I picked up was a Rockola Jump Bug arcade cabinet (shown right).&#xA0; It was in excellent condition and very clean inside.&#xD;&#xD;Next, I stripped everything from the cabinet - PCB, monitor, metal brackets, coin door, trim - everything!&#xA0; When only the wood was left, I coated every piece with a really good oil-based spray primer, and then coated it with matte black acrylic enamel (using a hand brush).&#xD;&#xD;I then added felt castors, and new trim (it was the unusual 5/8&#x201D; stuff).&#xA0; Next, I cleaned, repainted (if applicable) and re-added all metal components.&#xA0; Then I put in a new JAMMA wiring harness, spinner, buttons, control panel vinyl, and power supply and wired everything up.&#xA0; I also made sure that the monitor had new capacitors installed for a beautiful picture for years to come. The first picture below shows the cabinet before being primed and painted, and the second picture below shows the cabinet after all the components were re-added:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Finally, I created a custom Polybius marquee based on the one most commonly found on the Internet but color-matched the blue to the blue in the control panel.&#xA0; Below are two pictures of the finished product!&#xA0; And yes, after consuming countless NOS energy drinks and continuing my game 112 times (=112 quarters) over several hours, I finally beat DOH!&#xA0; No more nightmares for me.....&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
