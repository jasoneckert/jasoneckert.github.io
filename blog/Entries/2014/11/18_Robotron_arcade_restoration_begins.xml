    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I played the odd Williams arcade game when I was younger, and was pretty good at games like Stargate and Joust......but I was incredibly good at Robotron 2084 (the coolest game that Williams ever made).&#xD;&#xD;This past week I picked up a really clean Robotron 2084 arcade in excellent condition from Kijiji for $200. The picture to the right is what it looks like in my basement after I removed the monitor (I&#x2019;ve since put the monitor back in - I just removed it to make it lighter/easier to move down the stairs).&#xD;&#xD;The sides need a bit of touch up to the paint (not major, but I&#x2019;ll do a good job of it).&#xD;&#xD;However, the best part is that the arcade cabinet is complete (wiring, etc.) with the exception of the game circuit boards at the back (the operator must have removed those to sell).  Luckily, all of the components are in excellent shape (including the wiring), and so I can probably just stick in a Robotron 2084 board set and it will work.&#xD;&#xD;Another cool thing about this arcade cabinet is that the joysticks were upgraded to the ultra-awesome HAPP Perfect360 joysticks that are incredibly smooth and use optical sensors underneath for movement (instead of leaf switches), as shown in the picture below. For a game like Robotron, this should make a big difference!&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Stay tuned for the finished pics!&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE: Restoration has been completed!&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;I found a Robotron boardset that I repaired and put in the cab (thanks to Mike).  I also repainted the side art stencils, put on new textured t-molding, and added a new control panel overlay (thanks to Dave).  I was going to put in WICO leaf joysticks (which is what Robotron shipped with originally), but after playing Robotron with the HAPP Perfect360 joysticks, it wasn&#x2019;t a hard decision to keep them in there!  Here are some pics of the finished Robotron 2084 machine:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
