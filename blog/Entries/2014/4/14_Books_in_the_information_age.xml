    <richText>&lt;b&gt;How many of you still read physical books exclusively?&#xD;How many of you only read digital books (eBooks)?&#xD;&#xD;Me?&#xA0; I have a healthy mix of the two, and this blog post will tell you why.&#xD;&#xD;Up until this past decade, and for the past several hundred years, we transferred knowledge primarily via printed books - from fun stories and serious literature, to educational textbooks and scientific research.&#xA0; For those of us who were raised in an era without eBooks, printed books are considered a symbol of knowledge - a respected, and romantic icon that is good.&#xA0; Very good.&#xA0; We were raised looking at picture books with our parents.&#xA0; We learned to read from printed books in our elementary school.&#xA0; And we watched television shows and movies where books were depicted in various ways, sometimes mystical!&#xD;&#xD;Of course, computers and the Information Age have radically changed how we can get the same information previously available within printed books.&#xA0; I can buy an eBook version of nearly any new book (and many classics) for cheaper than the printed version, and have it within seconds across the Internet (versus driving to a bookstore or waiting for shipping from Amazon).&#xA0;&#xA0; It makes sense to ditch printed books, right?&#xA0; Well.....in my opinion, not exactly.....&#xD;&#xD;New generations today are still exposed to printed books (we&#x2019;re not a total digital society yet) - even my daughter reads printed books exclusively and refuses to read eBooks.&#xA0; And for me, a mix of the two makes perfect, logical sense.&#xD;&#xD;Firstly, lets look at the pros and cons of eBooks.&#xD;Pros:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	&#x2022;	Cheaper&#xD;	&#x2022;	Easier to obtain&#xD;	&#x2022;	Searchable by keyword&#xD;	&#x2022;	Don&#x2019;t use up any bookshelf space at all!&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cons:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	&#x2022;	Not great for books that contain photos (unless it is a PDF, and even then a printed version is still a better form factor)&#xD;	&#x2022;	Not something that can be easily &#x201C;leafed&#x201D; through (for example, to show someone something)&#xD;	&#x2022;	Have no collectable value, and cannot be physically signed&#xD;	&#x2022;	Not available for all titles, or for many older titles published before 2000&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;For example, if you are an avid novel reader (i.e. you burn through 3-4 books per month or more), it makes very good sense to purchase eBooks exclusively rather than printed books.&#xA0; Novels often don&#x2019;t have any pictures, so they are well suited to eBook format (and portable eBook readers like the Amazon Kindle).&#xA0; You won&#x2019;t fill up bookshelves full of books, and you&#x2019;ll save lots of money.&#xA0; If you are the type of person who sells their book to a used book store after reading it for a small amount, you won&#x2019;t be able to do that with an eBook, but then again, the $$ you get from the used book store will be less than the discount you got for buying an eBook (and you still get to keep the eBook).&#xD;&#xD;Another good choice for eBooks are textbooks.&#xA0; Since textbooks are used only for the course you are taking, you probably don&#x2019;t want a physical book hanging around.&#xA0; Plus, they are searchable!&#xD;&#xD;I&#x2019;m a big fan of Sci-Fi books, and most new Sci-Fi books I buy as eBooks.&#xA0; There are some books, however, that are so incredibly good, that I want a physical copy of to put on my bookshelf or get signed (I only have one bookshelf).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;I&#x2019;m also a big fan of technology, vintage computing and game books.&#xA0; For these books, I either buy a physical book or read the eBook depending on the features - if the book is available in digital format (even a scan, if it is a vintage book), I&#x2019;ll often get the digital copy, and if it is an amazing or collectible book, I&#x2019;ll find a used copy online for my bookshelf.&#xA0; Also, if the book is chalked full of pictures, I&#x2019;ll order a physical copy for my bookshelf.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;BUT.....I have to be careful since I don&#x2019;t want to have more than one bookshelf!&#xA0; As a result, before I buy any physical book, I make sure I&#x2019;ve first read a copy from a library or friend.&#xA0; &#x201C;Try before you buy&#x201D; is more important when it comes to physical books!&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The same can apply to eBooks too.&#xA0; For example, I have two Amazon Kindles - one I loan out to a friend if they want to read a particular book but aren&#x2019;t sure if they want to buy it.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Other friends of mine download the book from some torrent site on the net and read it - if they like it, they pay for a digital copy, and if they think it was a waste of time, they don&#x2019;t (this is sort of like natural selection for books - it contributes to weeding out crap on the book market).&#xD;&#xD;One important tip I have for eBook owners is:&#xA0; Ensure that you have a backup copy of your eBook without DRM! &#xA0; DRM (Digital Rights Management) puts restrictions on the book that you buy because publishers think that this curbs piracy, which is total bullshit.&#xA0; What DRM means to an eBook owner is that you could be prevented from reading your eBook in the future if the DRM stuff goes wonky (e.g. your Kindle dies).&#xA0; As a result, make sure you use a DRM-removal tool on all eBooks you buy that come with DRM (there is a plug-in for the free Calibre eBook Management Software that does this beautifully).&#xA0; Next, back up your non-DRM&#x2019;ed eBooks to at least a few places (external hard disk, DVD, Dropbox) so that you ensure that you don&#x2019;t lose your eBook if your computer dies.&#xD;&#xD;So what if you have a ton of books filling up bookshelves already?&#xA0; &#xD;What I&#x2019;d suggest doing is:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	1.	Pick the ones you really want to keep - they should easily fit on a single bookshelf with room for more.&#xD;	2.	For any books that you want to keep (perhaps because you&#x2019;ll want to read them again), but that you don&#x2019;t want to put on a bookshelf, buy an eBook of it if it is available.&#xD;	3.	Sell all of the books you don&#x2019;t want on your bookshelf to a used bookstore (which will likely pay for the previous step plus more).&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
