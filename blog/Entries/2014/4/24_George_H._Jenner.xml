    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Most of my posts focus on technology, gaming or something else of educational importance.&#xA0; However, this post is more of a personal one....&#xD;&#xD;The picture above is the only mall in the Hespeler area of Cambridge (where I grew up).&#xA0; If you look carefully, you&#x2019;ll see that it&#x2019;s currently being demolished (at the time of this post, it is almost entirely demolished).&#xA0; I moved back to Hespeler after school to raise my daughter because it was a place I knew well, and I have many fond memories of this mall because I used to work there teaching piano for George H. Jenner.&#xD;&#xD;I heard that George passed away over a decade ago of cancer, and his wife shortly after.&#xA0; I can&#x2019;t even find their obituaries on the Internet, so I don&#x2019;t know the exact dates.&#xA0; In fact, much of George&#x2019;s life took place long before the Internet - his only claim to fame on the Internet is a single picture of one of his albums:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;So I decided to write a proper post for my friend George - if anyone should be immortalized on the Internet, it should be George.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;He was born blind with a hairlip and only two fingers on each hand and two toes on each foot.&#xA0; But he was the nicest man I&#x2019;ve known, and one of the most amazing organ and piano player of all time (he used other parts of his hands to &#x201C;cheat&#x201D; to get specific notes to play together when needed).&#xA0; People would be stunned when they heard him play - he wasn&#x2019;t just &#x201C;good&#x201D; - he was &#x201C;OMFG AMAZING!&#x201D;&#xA0; He could make any piano or organ sing in a way that I&#x2019;ve never heard anyone do.&#xA0; Some of his albums and tapes occasionally appear on eBay (like the one shown below), but it&#x2019;s not the same as hearing it live.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;He started a very successful and posh piano store called &#x201C;George H. Jenner Pianos&#x201D; in downtown Hespeler, which later moved to the mall.&#xA0; He was trained as a piano tuner, and could do it by ear perfectly - his wife and him would come to our house and tune our old Evans Bros. piano.&#xA0; He even tuned for Liberace when he was in Canada.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;When I was 15, I was sick of working at KFC, and asked him for a job teaching piano at his studio (he ran a small piano studio next to his store), and he said yes.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ve never taught piano before that, but I had a burning desire to do it, and I was well organized and diligent.&#xA0; Here is a picture of George shaking my hand at one of our recitals in the mall outside of his store:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;That&#x2019;s when I really got to know George. When I wasn&#x2019;t teaching, I was in the store, hanging out and talking about anything and everything.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;I helped him move some pianos too - George had an illiterate farmer friend named Big Bill who had a mail truck that was converted to a piano moving truck.&#xA0; With George being blind and Bill being illiterate, someone needed to read the street signs to some place they&#x2019;ve never been before.&#xA0;&#xA0; I remember one time getting to the desired street, but we didn&#x2019;t know which way to turn on the street - George said &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s see, it&#x2019;s Tuesday.&#xA0; Turn left.&#x201D;&#xA0; ;-)&#xD;&#xD;George also had a glass eye (his real eye had to be removed years ago), and some times it would fall out and he&#x2019;d be looking for it with his wife on the floor.&#xA0; But he could always produce the correct change from his pocket (bills included) when he needed to buy something.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;What I remember the most about George, and what I&#x2019;ve come to realize is an incredibly important quality is his generosity and smile.&#xA0; George ALWAYS smiled, always joked, and always had a tremendous amount of faith in people that made them instantly like him.&#xA0; He was genuine, and someone who enjoyed life every day.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Every Christmas, he would throw a huge, expensive party at some fancy restaurant for all of the people he worked with (including suppliers, and friends).&#xA0; And this is someone who wasn&#x2019;t rich (he just owned a piano store).&#xA0; And he did this until the day his store closed.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Unfortunately, the few years I worked for George were also the years where the mall started to decline - when I started, the mall was mostly full, but you would see stores close almost every month.&#xA0; By the time George closed his shop and retired to a life of piano tuning only, there were less than a half dozen stores, and a movie theatre.&#xA0; It was sad.&#xD;&#xD;Before he closed his shop, I bought a brand new piano from him at cost (I still have it), as well as a slew of other instruments (which I sadly no longer have, including a massive Hammond B1 organ).&#xA0; I remember getting a really expensive piano bench with my piano by accident that meant that he was losing money on it.&#xA0; When he found out, he just said with a beaming smile &#x201C;Well, that&#x2019;s OK - it couldn&#x2019;t go to a nicer guy!&#x201D;&#xA0; That was George every day.&#xD;&#xD;But the piano is not what I appreciate the most from George - it was the lessons I learned from him.&#xA0; I won&#x2019;t go into detail about the backstory behind each one, but here they are:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	&#x2022;	There is no such thing as too much bass.&#xD;	&#x2022;	Life is too short not to smile every day.&#xD;	&#x2022;	Give people a chance, and they won&#x2019;t let you down.&#xD;	&#x2022;	Nobody&#x2019;s disabled.&#xA0; Make the most of what you&#x2019;ve got!&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;I later went into teaching full time, but it wasn&#x2019;t for piano - it was for computer science and Information Technology (IT), and I was incredibly successful at it (everyone wanted to be in my class ;-).&#xA0; I know that I wouldn&#x2019;t have been good at teaching whatsoever if George hadn&#x2019;t taken a chance on a 15-year-old kid who wanted to teach piano.&#xA0; And I&#x2019;ve always joked with my students that much of what I learned about teaching came from teaching piano - after all, it was &#x201C;hands-on&#x201D; training!&#xA0; But more importantly, George showed me how to be a good teacher:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	&#x2022;	I smile every day, and enjoy my students as much as they enjoy my humour.&#xD;	&#x2022;	I give everyone a chance.......and no one has let me down in 16 years.&#xD;	&#x2022;	Attitude is 90% of what makes you successful, and I remind my students at every opportunity:&#xA0; If you want to do it, you&#x2019;ll do it.&#xA0; Just make sure you have fun in the process.&#xA0; And I&#x2019;ll be here to help.&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;I have fond memories of working for George, and I certainly owe a lot to him. &#xD;Rest in peace good friend - I consider myself fortunate to have known you.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
