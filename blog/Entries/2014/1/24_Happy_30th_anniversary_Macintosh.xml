    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Today is the 30th anniversary of the Apple Macintosh computer - the computer, that from its conception, was designed to be &#x201C;the computer for the rest of us.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0; In other words, &#x201C;the computer whose design was entirely focused on making our lives easier with technology.&#x201D;&#xD;&#xD;And 30 years later, I would definitely say that Apple succeeded in doing just that.&#xA0; Of any tech company, Apple has made the most difference to people&#x2019;s lives, from the Macintosh to the PowerBook to the iMac to the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad to the AppleTV to the MacBook and more.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;I&#x2019;m a big user of Apple technology, and as someone who works in the tech industry, I have an intense appreciation for products that are well designed from both a user, hardware and software point of view.&#xA0; And right now, Apple shines above anything else in that space.&#xD;&#xD;As a result, you&#x2019;ll probably see plenty of other posts today about the 30th anniversary of the Macintosh - even iFixit did a teardown of the original Mac 128K: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/24/ifixit-tears-down-the-macintosh-128k-to-celebrate-the-computers-30th-birthday/"&gt;http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/24/ifixit-tears-down-the-macintosh-128k-to-celebrate-the-computers-30th-birthday/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&#xD;At home, I actually have a very large vintage Apple and Macintosh computer collection (see my &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/5F0C45BE-C12D-4330-9FB2-9BEACEC6DC5B"&gt;old computers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; page), and the picture at the top of this post is my daughter Mac next to my original Mac 128K computer from 1984.&#xA0; Her name is only a coincidence......really ;-)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
