    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I&#x2019;ve heard too many good reviews of the book&#xA0; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Final Day at Westfield Arcade&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; by Andy Hunt (2013), that I had to order it (you can get it from Amazon.com).&#xD;&#xD;In short, if you are going to read one book on arcade culture or history, this is the one.&#xA0; Not only does this book accurately reflect the rise and fall of the North American arcade culture, it does it through a great and emotional story that makes you feel like you are actually traveling back in time. Simply amazing. &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SPOILER ALERT &gt;&gt;&gt;&#xD;&#xD;PLOT:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The story is told by Mike in 1997 as he is closing his arcade and reflects on the time he spent there.&#xD;&#xD;Mike dropped out of last year university in 1980 to move closer to his grandfather who was in a nursing home with Alzheimer&#x2019;s (he was very close to his grandfather who raised him after both his parents died in a plane crash).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;He got a job at an arcade in the local mall and loved it because of the social interaction during the height of the arcade era.  Arcades were a magical place, and he made some close friends there, including Willie (the charismatic high-scorer and best friend), Rufus(the young know-it-all), and Gonzo (the casual pro).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;He guides you through some of the best times of his life while working there, including falling in love with a girl named Maddy who was aspiring to be an actress.&#xA0; But there were also bad times too.&#xA0; After Willie was crippled in a car accident while driving drunk on New Year&#x2019;s Eve 1985, he chickened out telling Maddy how he felt about her, and she moved to New York to pursue an acting career.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;When the owner of the arcade was about to shut down amid terrible sales in 1986, he used some money from his parent&#x2019;s trust to buy it and keep it alive for the next few years until Street Fighter II revived the arcade scene in 1991.&#xA0; But then his grandfather died, and the arcade scene died down again by 1997.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;He still kept in contact with Maddy (who now had a child from a failed relationship with a theatre director), and after some soul searching, he decided to close the arcade in 1997 and fly to New York to be closer to Maddy.&#xA0; He sold off most of the machines on the last day, and Willie, Gonzo, and Rufus came to be there on the last day to play the few remaining ones one last time.&#xA0; Mike then flies to NY and surprises Maddy at her apartment.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;MORE STUFF:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The book captures so much more than described in the plot outline I presented here.&#xA0; In many ways, I haven&#x2019;t really given a spoiler above, since the plot and characters have an incredible amount of depth I could never dream of presenting here.&#xD;&#xD;Throughout the book, there is constant talk about 80s fashion, music, MTV (which they had in the arcade on a big TV), specific arcade games and tactics, game industry statistics and their effect on popular culture, the types of crowds in the arcades over time, the types of things that attracted people to arcades over time, and why arcades ultimately failed.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;For example, Mike attributes the early 80s arcade boom to the plethora of original arcades, and notes that things slowed down considerably in 1985, which saw a flood of terrible games that had nothing &#x201C;special&#x201D; about them that attracted players.&#xA0; Plus, there were tons of knockoffs and bad sequels to some of the popular arcades of the early 80s that offered no original appeal, and the Nintendo NES offered cheaper gameplay at home.&#xA0; After the Street Fighter II craze of the early-mid 1990s, he notes that the Sony Playstation ended up having just as good graphics and games as arcade machines, and people just stopped coming - especially since games cost 50 cents or a dollar by that time.&#xD;&#xD;But the book doesn&#x2019;t have a sad tone &#x2013; it has a powerfully positive nostalgic tone!&#xD;&#xD;On the last day the arcade was open, Mike puts up a sign on the door that says:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;FINAL DAY OF BUSINESS &#xD;THANKS FOR SEVENTEEN GREAT YEARS&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;And after Willie returns to the arcade in a wheelchair after his accident, he says:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#x201C;If I could do it all over again, I&#x2019;d spend even more time here. I had a blast every single night I showed up, just dicking around with friends and playing arcade games.&#x201D;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;And when Mike closes the arcade, flies to New York, tells Maddy how he feels, and offers to help take care of her child so that she can pursue her dream of acting, he says:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve lived my dream for the past seventeen years &#x2013; I&#x2019;ve loved going to work every single day.&#xA0; Now I want to see you live your dream.&#x201D;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
