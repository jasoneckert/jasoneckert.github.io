    <richText>&lt;b&gt;A while ago, I bought a Jatre Specter arcade cocktail table, but it didn&#x2019;t have the original PCB.  Jatre Specter is the most famous bootleg of Space Invaders - it was released in 1979, and because it contained everything on a single PCB, it was a bit faster than Space Invaders (and more challenging).&#xA0; That being said, it was a direct copy of Space Invaders in every other way, since bootleggers simply copied the program stored in the ROM chips on the original arcade PCB and designed and implemented their own PCB using the detailed schematics that were available with the original arcade machines!&#xD;&#xD;Unfortunately, there is very little online about Jatre Specter - there are the odd pictures of it&#x2019;s cool cabinet, but nothing about the &#x201C;guts&#x201D; of it, such as the PCB.&#xA0; However, a local game shop (KW Vintage Games) got one in, and it had a graphical glitch (which makes it difficult to sell).&#xA0; So I offered to upgrade it to a multicade for them provided that I could keep the original PCB, and they agreed.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;So here are some pics of a Jatre Specter for posterity!&#xD;&#xD;The top of the cabinet:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;With the top flipped up to show the black &amp; white CRT (it had a fake color overlay just under the glass that provided a bit of color to the game).&#xA0; You&#x2019;ll also notice that the joystick ball on the right is missing:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The inside of the cabinet once the side was opened:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The PCB in more detail is shown below.&#xA0; The long chip on the right (with a plastic tie securing it in its socket) is the Intel 8080 CPU, and the two medium-sized chips in the lower right corner are the ROM chips that store the bootlegged Space Invaders program.&#xA0; &#xD;You&#x2019;ll also notice two stickers on the PCB - these are from the New-Way Sales Company, 2050 Kipling Ave in Rexdale (Toronto), phone # (416)PINBALL.&#xA0; New-Way was the largest coin-op vendor in Canada during the 1970s and likely put these bootlegs in various places around Toronto and other areas of Ontario to generate $$:&#xA0; &#xD;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
