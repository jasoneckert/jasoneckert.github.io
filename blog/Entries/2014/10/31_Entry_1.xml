    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I know it&#x2019;s been a while since I&#x2019;ve blogged last....I&#x2019;ve just been incredibly busy. This past month, I&#x2019;ve been teaching a video game class at the college, writing the 4th edition of my Linux+ book for Cengage on an accelerated schedule, and managing four technology faculties......all at the same time!&#xD;&#xD;But today, I got a new computer: A Mac Pro (the higher end 6-core Xeon model with dual AMD FirePro D500s).  I simply connect it via HDMI to my Alienware laptop and use the Fn+F8 key combination to switch between the Windows Desktop on my Alienware, and the Mac OS Desktop on my Mac Pro. Lots of power on a small amount of desk space!&#xD;&#xD;But seriously, the Mac Pro is phenomenal - not only is it small (and heavy), the performance is absolutely incredible!  Applications install unnaturally fast, programs open instantaneously, and my modeling software performs operations a multitude faster than on my Alienware!  I&#x2019;m still in awe as to how powerful the Mac Pro is.....next up: games!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
