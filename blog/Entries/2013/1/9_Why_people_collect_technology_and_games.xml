    <richText>&lt;b&gt;At a social gathering a few days ago, I was asked why it is that people (such as myself) collect stuff like vintage computers, video games, arcade games, and so on.&#xA0; The person asking was about a decade younger, and definitely not a technogeek.&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Some people may have thought of this question as an insult - indeed many collectors I know probably would have - but I love these questions because they allow me to string together pieces of information that I otherwise wouldn&#x2019;t have the opportunity to string together in order to give someone a glimpse into a great obsession.&#xD;&#xD;And to ensure that I have it down for later reference, I&#x2019;m writing this blog post.&#xA0; Isn&#x2019;t that what blogging is all about?&#xA0; Organizing and communicating your thoughts?&#xA0; Anywho.....let&#x2019;s get down to it.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vintage computer collecting&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is something I find a great many people doing in my profession. It isn&#x2019;t unusual to find a high school, college or university teacher collecting computers - nearly all of the vintage computer collectors I know teach some sort of technology or computer science (usually programming).&#xA0; Others are people who make a living with technology, often computer programming or Information Technology (IT).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;After driving to all sorts of crazy places to pick up vintage computers that other collectors are selling on forums or classified sites, you get to know them very well.&#xA0; In fact, vintage computer collectors are the chattiest bunch of people I know - they&#x2019;ll talk your ear off for hours!&#xA0; Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, I actually enjoy it, and I do it with other vintage computer collectors too.&#xA0; We have a mutual understanding of old technology and love to share it.&#xA0; We also have a mutual understanding of WHY we collect vintage computers.&#xD;&#xD;To sum it up, there are two main reasons why people collect vintage computers:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	1.	&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Because it is gratifying to feel like you are part of something bigger than yourself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xA0;Understanding vintage computing reminds us that our profession (something technology-related) has deep roots and plenty of grandeur.&#xA0; &#xD;	2.	&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Because we like to learn.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Computing has a rich and colorful history that is quickly forgotten as time progresses.&#xA0; Each vintage computer has a story that can be researched on the Internet, and plenty of information that can be learned.&#xA0; Every time I get a new vintage computer, I&#x2019;ve got an excuse to learn some fantastic stuff and play with some fantastic technology - for example, did you know that NeXTSTEP (the father of Mac OS X) was released for the HP-UX PA-RISC platform, and that it looks fairly similar to early versions of Mac OS X?&#xA0; And did you know that the metal case on the Commodore PET flips up like the hood of a car to show you the isolation transformer, power supply and PCB?&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;I should also point out that many vintage computer collectors like to focus on certain types of computers at first, and then branch out to other types later.&#xA0; For example, some collectors start collecting Commodore computers only and then branch out to PCs, Amigas, etc.&#xA0;&#xA0; I actually started collecting vintage Apple Macintosh computers before branching out to everything else.&#xA0; Only one collector I know hasn&#x2019;t branched out after many years - he still collects Apple computers only, and probably has the biggest Apple computer collection in Canada.&#xA0; Mind you, he also teaches user interface design at a Canadian university, so it makes perfect sense.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vintage home game system collecting&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is probably the most common type of collection that I see, whether it be collecting different vintage game consoles such as the Atari 2600 or Sega Genesis, or collecting the games themselves for a single vintage game console.&#xA0; The reason for this should be obvious - home video games have directly touched the lives of far more people, in a far more meaningful way, than computer science ever did.&#xA0; Most people I know played on home video game consoles growing up, regardless of whether they have a technical background or not, and even people who are too young to remember the consoles are getting into it.&#xA0; Don&#x2019;t be surprised to find a 15-year-old vintage video game collector who knows how to replace the 72-pin connector on his original Nintendo NES to ensure years of error-free gaming.&#xA0; There are even stores that specialize in selling vintage home games and aftermarket home game consoles - I know of 6 of them in my local area alone!&#xD;&#xD;Because there is such a wide audience of vintage home video game collectors, the reasons that they collect them can differ:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	&#x2022;	Generations that grew up with them usually collect them for &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;nostalgic reasons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xA0; They had so many good memories of the games as a kid, and find it nice to relive part of those memories.&#xD;	&#x2022;	Newer generations that didn&#x2019;t grow up with them often enjoy playing modern video games, and want to know how they evolved.&#xA0; Like vintage computer collectors, they &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;enjoy feeling that they are part of something bigger than themselves&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xA0; The video game industry is well established, and has a history that is just as colorful as that of computing.&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Regardless of what generation they are from, all vintage home video game collectors collect the games and game consoles because &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;they like to play them&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xA0; It isn&#x2019;t hard to find beauty in some of the oldest games out there - think Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Mega-Man, Zelda and Super Mario Bros!&#xA0; 8-bit graphics don&#x2019;t suck if the gameplay is awesome.&#xA0; Some of us even prefer the abstraction that 8-bit graphics give our imagination. To quote one of the final lines in the movie Wreck-it Ralph (2012): &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The gamers say we&#x2019;re &#x201C;retro&#x201D;......which I think means &#x201C;old but cool.&#x201D;&#xD;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vintage arcade machine collecting&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is my favorite form of collecting.&#xA0; It is a smaller, more close-knit community, and everyone I know in this community &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;grew up in the Golden Age of video games&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.....myself included. The Golden Age of video games was a time of intense optimism - technology was growing at an alarming rate for the first time in history and the possibilities were endless!&#xA0; And that optimism was most apparent in the electric glow of the video game arcade.&#xA0; To quote Van Burnham&#x2019;s book &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Supercade&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;It was a time when technology was king, status was determined by your high score, and videogames were blitzing the world.&#xD;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;In essence, this optimism is the main driving force behind pretty much every arcade machine collector I&#x2019;ve met - they &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;want to keep a piece of that time period alive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xA0; There is no shame in being optimistic!&#xA0;&#xA0; Van Burnham also collects arcade machines, and one of the final lines in her book Supercade reads:&#xA0; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I fell in love with videogames because I believed in the future....But what do we do now that the future has arrived?&#xD;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;Some vintage arcade game collectors stop there - they are content with collecting as many arcade machines as possible regardless of the game (my friend Matt is one of these).&#xA0; However, other vintage arcade game collectors, such as myself, have an additional reason to collect vintage arcade machines: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;they like to play the games themselves, and they like to play them on arcade hardware&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xA0; I won&#x2019;t just collect any game - I&#x2019;ll only collect the games that I loved to play myself, like Galaga, which I play daily.&#xA0; And there is nothing better than playing your favorite game on the original smooth metal joysticks and leaf-contact buttons of the early 1980s.&#xA0;&#xA0; I also enjoy modern games such as Halo, Super Meat Boy, and Angry Birds.....but nothing beats playing a Galaga arcade from 1981.&#xA0; You had to be there to understand.....which is why arcade game collecting will likely die with my generation.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
