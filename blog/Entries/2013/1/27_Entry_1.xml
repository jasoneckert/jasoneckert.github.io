    <richText>&lt;b&gt;As you can see from the picture at the top of this post, video games have evolved over the years, from the arcade and home console boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, to the game console boom of the 1990s and online PC gaming and mobile gaming boom of this past decade.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Beginning&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pong really was the beginning.&#xA0; And it was in bars and pinball arcades before it came to home Pong game consoles around 1975.&#xA0; Shortly after 1975, Pong was a household term.&#xA0; Magnavox Odyssey?&#xA0; What the hell was that?&#xD;&#xD;With the revenue from Pong (and a few other successful Atari arcade games such as Breakout), Atari went after the home market with a true home game console.&#xA0; In 1977, they released the Atari VCS (later called the Atari 2600), and it was an instant hit.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Around the same time, Space Invaders was unleashed, and popularized the video game industry worldwide, chewing up $2 billion in quarters in the first few years and causing a global coin shortage.&#xA0;&#xA0; Technically, Pong was the first video game, but it wasn&#x2019;t like video games of today - it was more like playing with an oscilloscope.&#xA0; But Space Invaders was a true video game by today&#x2019;s standards - it was YOU against the ALIENS, and time wasn&#x2019;t on your side as you blew them away amidst the thump thump thump background music.&#xA0; To most game developers, Space Invaders WAS the first video game.&#xA0; To Atari, it was a way to make the Atari VCS the dominant player in the market - people bought Atari VCSs just so they could play Space Invaders at home! &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Golden Age of Video Games&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The late 1970s and early 1980s is commonly called the Golden Age of Video Games because it saw the rapid adoption of home games and the proliferation of video game arcades and arcade machines.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;After Space Invaders was released in 1978, everyone and their mother started making video games, and they got good very quickly - by 1979 we had Asteroids, by 1980 we had Pac-man, and by 1981 we had Galaga and Donkey Kong.&#xA0; Kids hung out in video game arcades, played arcade games at their corner store and pizza parlor, as well as played them at home on their Atari VCS (the other game consoles of the era didn&#x2019;t come close to reaching the number of games released for the Atari VCS during this time).&#xD;&#xD;PCs were fairly uncommon in the late 1970s due to their cost, but there were some games available for them.&#xA0; It was just cheaper for the average family to buy an Atari VCS.&#xA0;&#xA0; By early 1983, the home game console and arcade markets got saturated and there was a decline in the industry overall.&#xA0; About this same time, more and more people started buying computers - especially the Commodore 64, which was relatively inexpensive, yet had amazing sound and graphics abilities.&#xA0; And the number of computer games for it (and software in general) was incredible.&#xA0; If it existed, it existed for the Commodore 64.&#xA0; And the Commodore 64 became (and still is) the world&#x2019;s #1 selling computer of all time.&#xA0; Computer gaming started to rise in the early 1980s, and it hasn&#x2019;t slowed down since.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Rebirth of the Home Console&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Atari VCS started to wane by the early 1980s.&#xA0; But in 1985, the Nintendo NES revitalized the home gaming industry.&#xA0; The NES had spectacular graphics, and ended up having a ton of available games.&#xA0; Everyone had one, and other manufacturers joined in on the game (remember the SEGA Genesis and the Turbografx-16?).&#xA0; The home game console market hasn&#x2019;t slowed since.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Rebirth of the Arcade&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Arcade games were still around in the 1980s - after all, arcade games at the time had far better graphics and gameplay compared to home console games or computer games.&#xA0; But there were fewer arcades around, and most arcade machines were now in bars, corner stores, malls and pizza parlors.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;In 1991, Street Fighter II changed all of that.&#xA0; Street Fighter II allowed you to fight with another player with awesome custom techniques using a joystick and 6 buttons.&#xA0; It was immediately successful (they sold 60,000 arcade machines in North America alone), and ushered in a ton of new fighting games that popularized the arcade scene for almost a decade.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transitioning from the 1990s to the 2000s&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;By the early 1990s, most people had computers, and they were almost entirely IBM PC clones.&#xA0;&#xA0; As a result, the PC gaming industry boomed in the 1990s (remember Wolfenstein 3D?) and PC manufacturers were pushed to bring out more and more hardware to meet the demands of the PC software and game industries.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Home game consoles became even more popular throughout the 1990s.&#xA0; By the late 1990s, both home game consoles and PCs were incredibly powerful and had a ton of amazing arcade-quality games available.&#xA0; Consequently, the arcade scene died out shortly after 2000.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Another thing happened around 2000 - people started playing games across the Internet with other people, both on their PCs and game consoles!&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;On the home console side, the market had three main players: Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft (a new, but very successful player in the game console market).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;On the PC side, the number and type of games was flourishing.&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;By the late 2000s, tablets and smartphones (which are essentially mobile computers) entered the scene, and became insanely popular as game platforms.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Future?&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;What will the future hold for us when it comes to game platforms?&#xA0; Will mobile gaming replace game consoles and PCs?&#xA0; Will we have chips implanted in our heads to experience virtual reality?&#xA0; No matter what happens, we&#x2019;ll definitely have some freakin&#x2019; awesome games!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
