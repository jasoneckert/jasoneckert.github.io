                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="Body">At a social gathering a few days ago, I was asked why it is that people (such as myself) collect stuff like vintage computers, video games, arcade games, and so on.  The person asking was about a decade younger, and definitely not a technogeek.   <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Some people may have thought of this question as an insult - indeed many collectors I know probably would have - but I love these questions because they allow me to string together pieces of information that I otherwise wouldn’t have the opportunity to string together in order to give someone a glimpse into a great obsession.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">And to ensure that I have it down for later reference, I’m writing this blog post.  Isn’t that what blogging is all about?  Organizing and communicating your thoughts?  Anywho.....let’s get down to it.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Vintage computer collecting<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">This is something I find a great many people doing in my profession. It isn’t unusual to find a high school, college or university teacher collecting computers - nearly all of the vintage computer collectors I know teach some sort of technology or computer science (usually programming).  Others are people who make a living with technology, often computer programming or Information Technology (IT).  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">After driving to all sorts of crazy places to pick up vintage computers that other collectors are selling on forums or classified sites, you get to know them very well.  In fact, vintage computer collectors are the chattiest bunch of people I know - they’ll talk your ear off for hours!  Don’t get me wrong, I actually enjoy it, and I do it with other vintage computer collectors too.  We have a mutual understanding of old technology and love to share it.  We also have a mutual understanding of WHY we collect vintage computers.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">To sum it up, there are two main reasons why people collect vintage computers:<br /></p>
                <ol>
                  <li style="line-height: 20px; padding-left: 30px; text-indent: -20px; " class="full-width" value="1">
                    <p style="text-indent: -20px; " class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="font-size: 14px; " class="Bullet">1.</span><span style="width: 8px; " class="inline-block"></span><span class="style_1">Because it is gratifying to feel like you are part of something bigger than yourself.</span> Understanding vintage computing reminds us that our profession (something technology-related) has deep roots and plenty of grandeur.  <br /></p>
                  </li>
                  <li style="line-height: 20px; padding-left: 30px; text-indent: -20px; " class="full-width" value="2">
                    <p style="text-indent: -20px; " class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="font-size: 14px; " class="Bullet">2.</span><span style="width: 8px; " class="inline-block"></span><span class="style_1">Because we like to learn.</span> Computing has a rich and colorful history that is quickly forgotten as time progresses.  Each vintage computer has a story that can be researched on the Internet, and plenty of information that can be learned.  Every time I get a new vintage computer, I’ve got an excuse to learn some fantastic stuff and play with some fantastic technology - for example, did you know that NeXTSTEP (the father of Mac OS X) was released for the HP-UX PA-RISC platform, and that it looks fairly similar to early versions of Mac OS X?  And did you know that the metal case on the Commodore PET flips up like the hood of a car to show you the isolation transformer, power supply and PCB?<br /><br /></p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="Body">I should also point out that many vintage computer collectors like to focus on certain types of computers at first, and then branch out to other types later.  For example, some collectors start collecting Commodore computers only and then branch out to PCs, Amigas, etc.   I actually started collecting vintage Apple Macintosh computers before branching out to everything else.  Only one collector I know hasn’t branched out after many years - he still collects Apple computers only, and probably has the biggest Apple computer collection in Canada.  Mind you, he also teaches user interface design at a Canadian university, so it makes perfect sense.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Vintage home game system collecting<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">This is probably the most common type of collection that I see, whether it be collecting different vintage game consoles such as the Atari 2600 or Sega Genesis, or collecting the games themselves for a single vintage game console.  The reason for this should be obvious - home video games have directly touched the lives of far more people, in a far more meaningful way, than computer science ever did.  Most people I know played on home video game consoles growing up, regardless of whether they have a technical background or not, and even people who are too young to remember the consoles are getting into it.  Don’t be surprised to find a 15-year-old vintage video game collector who knows how to replace the 72-pin connector on his original Nintendo NES to ensure years of error-free gaming.  There are even stores that specialize in selling vintage home games and aftermarket home game consoles - I know of 6 of them in my local area alone!<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Because there is such a wide audience of vintage home video game collectors, the reasons that they collect them can differ:<br /></p>
                <ol>
                  <li style="line-height: 20px; padding-left: 30px; text-indent: -20px; " class="full-width">
                    <p style="text-indent: -20px; " class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="font-size: 14px; " class="Bullet">•</span><span style="width: 15px; " class="inline-block"></span>Generations that grew up with them usually collect them for <span class="style_1">nostalgic reasons</span>.  They had so many good memories of the games as a kid, and find it nice to relive part of those memories.<br /></p>
                  </li>
                  <li style="line-height: 20px; padding-left: 30px; text-indent: -20px; " class="full-width">
                    <p style="text-indent: -20px; " class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="font-size: 14px; " class="Bullet">•</span><span style="width: 15px; " class="inline-block"></span>Newer generations that didn’t grow up with them often enjoy playing modern video games, and want to know how they evolved.  Like vintage computer collectors, they <span class="style_1">enjoy feeling that they are part of something bigger than themselves</span>.  The video game industry is well established, and has a history that is just as colorful as that of computing.<br /><br /></p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="Body">Regardless of what generation they are from, all vintage home video game collectors collect the games and game consoles because <span class="style_1">they like to play them</span>.  It isn’t hard to find beauty in some of the oldest games out there - think Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Mega-Man, Zelda and Super Mario Bros!  8-bit graphics don’t suck if the gameplay is awesome.  Some of us even prefer the abstraction that 8-bit graphics give our imagination. To quote one of the final lines in the movie Wreck-it Ralph (2012): <span class="style_2">The gamers say we’re “retro”......which I think means “old but cool.”<br /></span></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Vintage arcade machine collecting<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">This is my favorite form of collecting.  It is a smaller, more close-knit community, and everyone I know in this community <span class="style_1">grew up in the Golden Age of video games</span>.....myself included. The Golden Age of video games was a time of intense optimism - technology was growing at an alarming rate for the first time in history and the possibilities were endless!  And that optimism was most apparent in the electric glow of the video game arcade.  To quote Van Burnham’s book <span class="style_2">Supercade</span>: <span class="style_2">It was a time when technology was king, status was determined by your high score, and videogames were blitzing the world.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">In essence, this optimism is the main driving force behind pretty much every arcade machine collector I’ve met - they <span class="style_1">want to keep a piece of that time period alive</span>.  There is no shame in being optimistic!   Van Burnham also collects arcade machines, and one of the final lines in her book Supercade reads:  <span class="style_2">I fell in love with videogames because I believed in the future....But what do we do now that the future has arrived?<br /></span></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="Body">Some vintage arcade game collectors stop there - they are content with collecting as many arcade machines as possible regardless of the game (my friend Matt is one of these).  However, other vintage arcade game collectors, such as myself, have an additional reason to collect vintage arcade machines: <span class="style_1">they like to play the games themselves, and they like to play them on arcade hardware</span>.  I won’t just collect any game - I’ll only collect the games that I loved to play myself, like Galaga, which I play daily.  And there is nothing better than playing your favorite game on the original smooth metal joysticks and leaf-contact buttons of the early 1980s.   I also enjoy modern games such as Halo, Super Meat Boy, and Angry Birds.....but nothing beats playing a Galaga arcade from 1981.  You had to be there to understand.....which is why arcade game collecting will likely die with my generation.</p>
