    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Joe Biden has announced that he wants to meet with video game developers to discuss how to deal with gun violence in the United States.&#xA0; This is essentially the same as wanting to meet with Mattel, the makers of Hot Wheels toys, to discuss car safety for the automotive industry.&#xD;&#xD;Essentially, it&#x2019;s a retarded mix of:&#xD;a) People not understanding what causes gun violence in the US, and &#x2028;b) Wanting to ride a historically popular scapegoat that makes billions of dollars &#x2028;&#xD;Now THAT sounds like something appealing for a politician ;-)&#xA0; But realistically, it&#x2019;s more like this comic:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;If the US wants to understand why they have a gun problem, they just need to look at any other country in the world....say, for example, us hosers in Canada.&#xA0; We are right next to the US, and have an identical culture and similar economy.&#xA0;&#xA0; We grew up watching the same shows, listening to the same music, going to McDonalds, and playing the same video games.&#xA0; The only difference between us hosers and Americans, is that we weren&#x2019;t brought up generation-over-generation thinking that we had the right to have a gun.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;So why pin gun violence on video games?&#xD;&#xD;Well, since the 1970s, the luddites have heavily criticized video games because new things are scary.&#xA0; One town in Texas even tried to get the game Space Invaders made illegal because so many kids in the town were playing the game (luckily, they didn&#x2019;t succeed).&#xA0; But not everyone was completely retarded back then either - check out the old news clip at the bottom of this post (watch it until the end).&#xA0; The news team does a good job of showing both sides in the correct light.&#xA0; While this news clip is 30 years old, everything in it still applies to video games today.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;At their core, video games are simply games.&#xA0; Games that are played on some kind of computer that has controls and a video display, whether it be an old arcade machine, or a game console, home computer, mobile tablet or smartphone.&#xA0; And we&#x2019;ve been playing games (violent and non-violent) for thousands of years.&#xA0; In this particular situation, &#x201C;the medium is not the message.&#x201D; (my apologies, Marshall McLuhan ;-)&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
