    <richText>&lt;b&gt;The Internet is full of news today about how Atari and their French parent company have declared bankruptcy (actually, they are seeking bankruptcy protection, which is fundamentally the same thing - few companies every recover from it).&#xD;&#xD;But why is everyone all upset about it?&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;They are upset because Atari won our hearts and minds in the 1970s and 1980s with their amazing arcade games and home consoles.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Atari made the first popular arcade game (Pong), and followed with some of the most memorable arcade games of all time: Breakout, Asteroids, Centipede, Tempest, Gauntlet, Missile Command, Tetris, Star Wars, and many more.&#xD;&#xA0; &#xD;And lest we forget the amazing Atari 2600 home console that&#xA0; had a bazillion games available for it.&#xA0; Everyone had one prior to the Nintendo.&#xA0; Today, pictures of the Atari 2600 controller are the standard icon of home video gaming from that era.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;In other&#xA0; words, Atari is really the grandfather of video games - Atari made the arcade scene happen, and they were the ones that popularized home video game consoles.&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;That is why people are upset at the recent news.&#xA0; Nobody likes to hear a great inventor of a lifestyle-changing technology die, whether it be a person like Steve Jobs, or an inanimate company like Atari.&#xA0; A little piece of us dies inside.&#xD;&#xD;Many people from my generation have fond memories of video game arcades, and playing games on our Atari 2600 consoles growing up.&#xA0; Those of younger generations have a respect for the company that put video games on the map and inevitably led to the enjoyment we get from them today.&#xA0; Regardless, every gamer knows what Atari is - Atari is where it all began.&#xD;&#xD;But let&#x2019;s distance ourselves from those notions for now.&#xA0; What is Atari, really?&#xA0; It&#x2019;s just a company started by Nolan Bushnell in 1972 (Nolan is an awesome person, who is still alive and someone you want to hear speak on Youtube).&#xA0; He sold it to Warner in 1976, who took the Atari 2600 and the first few Atari PCs (the 400 and 800) to massive popularity.&#xA0; Warner sold it to the original founder of Commodore, Jack Tramiel, after Jack left Commodore.&#xA0; Jack thought Atari should be a PC company, and he ran it into the ground (Atari PCs in the late 1980s and 1990s?&#xA0; Give me a break.).&#xA0; Tramiel sold it to Hasbro, who kept it for a few years for the name and then sold it to Infogrames in France, who really didn&#x2019;t do much with it other than re-release a few of their old games for the iPad.&#xA0; Few people after the mid 1990s thought that Atari was still around (see the timeline at the top of this post).&#xD;&#xD;Atari has essentially been out of the gaming business for the past 20 years - what they&#x2019;ve produced on the gaming side has been very weak - a handful of largely unknown arcade games in the 1990s (mostly subcontracted to Midway), and no real hits for modern platforms after that.&#xA0;&#xA0; I&#x2019;m surprised they lasted this long.&#xD;&#xD;But Atari is a cultural icon that will last forever - in people&#x2019;s minds, they will always be the imaginary cosmic force that gave birth to the video game industry.&#xA0; Because of this, Atari is a very powerful brand.&#xA0; I think that some company may just snatch up the rights to the brand and carry the torch.&#xA0; And if they actually make some good games under that brand, people will flock to them like a bunch of scruffy nerfherders to a Star Wars flick.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
