    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Just over a decade ago, the dotcom bubble burst, and for the next 3-4 years, the IT industry (and IT job market) was in a slump.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;During the last presentation I did for Game On 2.0 on August 29th, one of the audience members asked me what the dotcom bubble actually was.&#xA0; I supplied the standard Web answer of &#x201C;overspending in the IT market&#x201D; and &#x201C;mismanagement of IT resources&#x201D; (or something like that).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;As odd as this sounds, I&#x2019;ve never actually been asked that question before......and I&#x2019;ve&#xA0; taught IT classes for a decade since the dotcom bubble.&#xA0; So, this question hasn&#x2019;t sat well with me these past several weeks.&#xA0; This blog post is essentially a much better explanation of what the dotcom bubble was, so that I don&#x2019;t think about it again ;-)&#xD;&#xD;To understand what the dotcom bubble was, first imagine all of the technologies that we take for granted today.&#xA0; They all revolve around the Internet.&#xA0; We spend an incredibly large amount of time on the Internet - Googling anything and everything, buying stuff online, using Facebook, tweeting photos, watching more YouTube than television, etc.&#xA0; We access the Internet from computers, tablets and smartphones - it&#x2019;s access anywhere, anytime, and it&#x2019;s become such an ingrained part of our life:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	&#x2022;	When I&#x2019;m at a store and see an item I want, I&#x2019;ll Google it to see if I&#x2019;m actually getting a better deal elsewhere.&#xA0; Plus, I&#x2019;ll check the store website for coupons, which the cashier will scan right from my phone.&#xD;	&#x2022;	I post pictures I take with my phone on Facebook and Twitter daily, and well as cool articles I&#x2019;ve seen in my news feed (what&#x2019;s a newspaper?).&#xA0; I read other peoples posts and repost them too.&#xD;	&#x2022;	If I want to see an episode of something, or a part of a movie I remember from years ago, I&#x2019;ll YouTube it.&#xA0; Plus, who doesn&#x2019;t use YouTube for music?&#xA0; Nobody.&#xD;	&#x2022;	I buy stuff online - lots of it - books, collectibles, nerdy things.&#xA0; Whatever.&#xA0; And I pay with Paypal. I also pay my bills, renew my license plates, and book reservations online.&#xD;	&#x2022;	I play games online, as well as read forums and blogs online.&#xA0; If it&#x2019;s cool, it will be reposted on a ton of sites like Reddit.&#xA0; And if I find it cool, I can repost it with my comments to Facebook, Twitter or Google+ with a single click.&#xD;	&#x2022;	And much much more.....&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chances are that you probably do 90% of the stuff I just listed above.&#xA0; This is what the Internet was always intended to be, and people knew this back in 2000 - they knew it would be big and that everyone would be using it.&#xA0; They also knew that business models would be Internet-based, and that Internet-based advertising would be the way of the future.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The problem was that everyone wanted today&#x2019;s Internet back in 2000.&#xA0; It was a time of intense optimism for Internet-based technology.&#xA0; Everyone invested a ton of money into trying to make it happen, but it didn&#x2019;t.&#xA0; We just weren&#x2019;t ready back then.&#xA0; The dotcom bubble burst around 2001/2002.&#xA0; Many technology companies found that their ideas and investments were not going to make enough money to stay afloat, and ended up going bust.&#xA0; Other companies became overly-cautious about investing in technology and systems for the next 3-4 years - they made sure that any technology investments made would result in a return that justified the investment.&#xA0; The term ROI (Return on Investment) lined every technical product whitepaper. &#xD;&#xD;So, in short:&#xA0; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The dotcom bubble was a situation caused by technological optimism - technology companies wanted today&#x2019;s Internet culture back in 2000.&#xA0; Many of them invested heavily in it, found out that they couldn&#x2019;t make a sustainable return on their investment, and folded. &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;I&#x2019;ve often wondered whether the companies that folded when the dotcom bubble burst would have been successful today.&#xA0; Probably....provided that some other company hadn&#x2019;t beaten them to the punch and saturated the market.&#xA0; I remember companies back in 2000 that had ideas similar to Facebook and YouTube.&#xA0; These were small companies, with talented people and big plans.&#xA0; Too bad those companies were 5+ years ahead of their time.....&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
