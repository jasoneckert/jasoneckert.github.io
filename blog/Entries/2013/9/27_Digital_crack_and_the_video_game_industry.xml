    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Video games appeal to our desire for fun and exploration, and impulse buys are not uncommon as a result.&#xA0; The video game industry has always known this, and they&#x2019;ve based their business models around it too!&#xA0; From the old arcade games that were designed to suck in your quarters, to the flashy cartridge or box art that came with your console and PC games, to the extra action figures and hats that you got if you bought the special edition of the upcoming version of Halo.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ll admit that I&#x2019;ve been a sucker for all of it, and never thought that my dollars were poorly spent.&#xD;&#xD;However, there has been one implied rule that has made gamers happy with their purchases from the 1970s to the 2000s:&#xA0; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;A game should always provide enough value for your money.&#xA0; &#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;This value could be in time, novelty, or extras.&#xA0; Spending a quarter on an arcade game like Pac-man, where you got 2 minutes of fun gameplay in a social atmosphere was worth it, but paying $1 for 2 minutes of gameplay is a waste (which is why the arcades died out in the late 1990s - you didn&#x2019;t get as much value as you would playing on a game console or PC).&#xA0;&#xA0; Spending $50 on a game cartridge that gives you 40+ hours of gameplay is also worth it, especially since you own the game forever, can play it with friends, can loan it to others, or even sell it to a used game shop. Spending $70 on a PC game DVD that you own forever and gives you 80+ hours of gameplay is definitely worth it, especially if it can be played with others online and comes with some cool figure or t-shirt.&#xD;&#xD;Today, however, most games are downloaded digitally, and contain &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;DRM (Digital Rights Management) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;that allows you to play your game on a specific platform as long as that platform can contact servers across the Internet to validate your license.&#xA0; In other words, it&#x2019;s not yours to own forever - you are essentially &#x201C;renting&#x201D; the game for however long the company decides to keep the systems that support that game running.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;And, if that&#x2019;s not enough, games released over these past few years have been designed with &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;DLC (downloadable content) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;virtual items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; that cost extra - something that my colleague Bryan Griffiths calls &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;digital crack&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; since people today often buy it on impulse without thinking of what they are &#x201C;actually&#x201D; getting for their money.&#xA0; And for younger generations who don&#x2019;t remember the arcade, physical game cartridges, or CD/DVD-ROM games, they may think that it is normal.&#xA0; They&#x2019;re the &#x201C;buyers&#x201D; and the game companies are their &#x201C;suppliers&#x201D; continually trying to take advantage of them.&#xD;&#xD;Say that you download a mobile game that you find fun, but you quickly realize that there are only 2 levels included with the free version.&#xA0; To get the remaining levels, you have to spend $9.99.&#xA0; And by the time you are halfway through those levels, some new ones are released for another $9.99, but since you already bought the first set, you can get them for only $7.99....what a deal!&#xA0; Now, some of your friends have started playing the game, and you&#x2019;ve got a little competition going where you try to get a better score than they do (the game posts results to Facebook), and if you want to make it easier to get a better score, you can buy certain items that give you extra ability in the game that range from $2.99 to $4.99, but you have to &#x201C;earn&#x201D; the ability to buy these by getting to a certain level, so it feels like a privilege.&#xA0; After a month, the game gets kind of boring, or there is another new game out that your friends are playing, so you end up not playing it anymore.&#xA0; Say that you spent $9.99 + $7.99 + $2.99 + $2.99 + $2.99 + $3.99 + $4.99 + $4.99 = approximately $41 on the game, and you played about 15 minutes of it each day on average.&#xA0; You basically just spent $41 on less than 15 hours of gameplay on a game that you don&#x2019;t even own a permanent copy of, but you probably never noticed this because you spent it in tiny &#x201C;chunks&#x201D; that seemed worth it at the time......and after you got addicted to the game itself.&#xA0; This is the principle of digital crack.&#xD;&#xD;Digital crack is also very common with bigger games today.&#xA0; Say that you buy a digital (download-only) copy of Halo 666 for Xbox 360 for $60 on sale (Halo 666 doesn&#x2019;t exist...I just made the name up as an example).&#xA0; You play Halo 666 for about 10 hours with a friend, complete the whole game and want to play more - so you choose to download additional level packs for $10 each (there are 4 in total).&#xA0; These level packs each take about 5 hours to complete with a friend of yours.&#xA0; So, basically, you spent $100 for 30 hours of gameplay for you and a friend on a game that, once again, you don&#x2019;t own, and which you can&#x2019;t loan to others or sell.&#xA0; For the game company, they just got $100 from you and don&#x2019;t have to worry about creating physical media, or losing potential sales because you loaned it to a friend or sold it to a used game store so someone else could buy it cheaper.&#xD;&#xD;Lots of hardcore gamers are complaining about DLC right now on the Internet as an obvious cash grab, but there are many more who are oblivious to it and simple pay the money since others are doing it.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s only a matter of time before consumers realize they are being ripped off en masse, but that doesn&#x2019;t matter to game companies - they&#x2019;ll rake in as much money as they can until that happens, and then change their direction.&#xA0; Like all crack dealers, it&#x2019;s all about their bottom line ;-)&#xD;&#xD;So, if you are a gamer that doesn&#x2019;t have a lot of money to waste (or has money but doesn&#x2019;t want to waste it), then simply follow these game buying guidelines:&#xD;1. Always try a game before you buy it!&#xA0; Games are like movies - there are a lot of crappy ones on the market right now ;-)&#xA0; Shop around and don&#x2019;t just buy a game to try it out.&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	1.	Before making a purchase of a game, ask yourself:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	&#x2022;	How much gameplay time am I going to get out of this game?&#xD;	&#x2022;	Do I own the game?&#xA0; In other words, can I sell it afterwards, or loan it to a friend?&#xD;	&#x2022;	Do I have a friend who can loan me the game to play (or let me play it with them)?&#xD;	&#x2022;	Is there a free or cheaper game on the market that I&#x2019;ll enjoy as much?&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Rely on games and digital content that your friends have purchased whenever possible.&#xA0; For example, say that there are 4 games that came out this year that you really want to play.&#xA0; if you and three of your friends decide to buy one copy of each game and lend it to each other (or play cooperatively), you will have effectively purchased 4 games for the price of 1 game.&#xA0; Game companies are getting much more aggressive when it comes to generating money today, so there is no reason why you don&#x2019;t have to be more aggressive as a game consumer!&#x2028;&#xD;4. Limit the digital content that you buy - in most cases, you can&#x2019;t lend or sell it afterwards, so it isn&#x2019;t &#x201C;real&#x201D; content.&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	1.	If you are buying digitally content:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	&#x2022;	Remember that you are simply &#x201C;renting&#x201D; the digital content - you don&#x2019;t actually own it.&#xD;	&#x2022;	Keep a small journal of how much you are spending on the game in total (DLC, virtual items, etc.).&#xA0; Before buying additional digital content, check this journal to see how much you&#x2019;ve already spent on the game and think about whether it&#x2019;s worth it.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
