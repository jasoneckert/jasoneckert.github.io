    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Back in July, I picked up an old 2-player Tron arcade cocktail machine that I wasn&#x2019;t really sure what to do with.&#xA0; Although I loved the Disney Tron movie, I&#x2019;ve always thought that the Midway arcade game, well, sucked.&#xA0; But Midway cocktail arcade tables are well built and hard to find, so I thought that I&#x2019;d figure out what to do with it later.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The picture at the top of this post is the finished machine, but it took a while to get it done.&#xA0; All-in-all, I&#x2019;m actually quite pleased with how it turned out, but it took a long time for me to decide what I actually wanted to do with it.&#xD;&#xD;The wood veneer was in surprisingly good shape for it&#x2019;s age, but the machine didn&#x2019;t have the underlay that goes under the glass, and the monitor had a ton of screen burn-in and needed new capacitors.&#xA0; The vinyl overlay was worn, but the two metal control panels were in excellent shape - and although Tron used a spinner on the left and a small joystick on the right, the joystick hole just happened to be perfectly drilled in the metal for a standard-sized pushbutton:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;What that meant is that I could easily replace the spinner on the left with a joystick and then have a single pushbutton on the right for firing - that would work well for most classic games available on a 60-in-1 multicade board.&#xA0; So, I was thinking of either making it a Tron multicade arcade, or do something cool, like get custom Polybius artwork printed up and totally convert it to a Polybius multicade arcade machine!&#xD;&#xD;So, first things first, I restored the two control panels by removing the old vinyl, sanding the glue off and putting on a fresh new black vinyl cover.&#xA0; Then I installed a red &#x201C;glow ball&#x201D; joystick and pushbutton as well as put back the original two 1cm start buttons (no drilling into the metal control panel required!):&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The second control panel was identical to the first, but I just covered the two 1cm holes used for the 1P and 2P start buttons with vinyl (they normally aren&#x2019;t needed).&#xA0; Then I got to work on the cabinet.....&#xD;&#xD;The first thing I noticed on the inside of the cabinet was the serial number affixed above the coin door:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;I carefully removed it, had it laminated, and stuck it back in place when everything was done.&#xD;&#xD;Next, I removed everything, sanded and repainted all black metal parts, and polished any shiny metal parts.&#xA0; Next, I cleaned, sanded and coated the inside of the cabinet with bright orange enamel.&#xA0; This makes components easier to see and makes the cabinet just as nice to look at inside as outside:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Next, I restored the coin door.&#xA0; This wasn&#x2019;t too hard since it was is fairly good shape - I just needed to disassemble, clean and polish the metal parts, powder coat the front of the door, and install the coin mechanisms:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Rather than put the old CRT (TV) monitor back in, I simply installed a new 21&#x201D; LED monitor that fit nice and snug - I affixed it to a plywood base that I bolted into the old CRT mounts, and covered it with a piece of frosted plexi with a nice vinyl border to match the display area:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;At this point, it was still early August, and I wasn&#x2019;t comfortable making it into a multicade machine.&#xA0; So it sat in my basement for almost 2 months while I pondered what to do with it.&#xD;&#xD;Then a few things fell into place.&#xA0; First, I managed to get a free original vinyl Tron underlay from a guy on the CGCC (Classic Game Collectors Canada) forums.&#xA0;&#xA0; Second, I managed to buy a Ms. Pac-man/Galaga 20th Reunion (Class of &#x2019;81) arcade PCB for a reasonable price (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/69D61847-4FF0-4B02-B616-6E3B42873F34"&gt;click here to see my earlier post about it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;).&#xA0; I&#x2019;ve wanted one of these for a while because they have a continue feature you can&#x2019;t get with regular Pac-man/Ms. Pac-man/Galaga, but they usually go for over $300 (way too much for any PCB).&#xA0; They also require two sets of start buttons (1P/2P for Ms. Pac-man and 1P/2P for Galaga).&#xA0; Wait a second!&#xA0; Both of the control panels on the Tron cocktail were drilled identically, so the first side could have 1P Ms. Pac-man and 1P Galaga, and the second side could have 2P Ms. Pac-man and 2P Galaga if I just install two more 1cm start buttons! &#xD;&#xD;So that is what I did.&#xA0; To wire it up, I first installed a new piece of plywood.&#xA0; Then I mounted a new HAPP power supply, the Class of &#x2019;81 PCB (red), and a CGA-to-VGA converter card to it so that the Class of &#x2019;81 PCB video output would work with the 21&#x201D; LED monitor.&#xA0; Then I installed a new JAMMA wiring harness and cabled it to all the components:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Then I fired it up and played some games!&#xA0; But there was a problem.&#xA0; The &#x201C;glow ball&#x201D; joysticks were too sensitive to play properly in later levels of Pac-man and Ms. Pac-man. Plus, they sat pretty high, so when you took your hand off the joystick, you often hit it on the glass above.&#xD;&#xD;No problemo......the Playdium Store in Toronto sells official replacement Class of &#x2019;81 joysticks for $30 that sit much lower, and were designed specifically for these games!&#xA0; So I picked up two of those and installed them:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Now it plays perfectly!&#xA0; And I&#x2019;m very very happy with how it turned out.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;I&#x2019;ve wanted a Class of &#x2019;81 arcade machine for a while, but they usually go for $2000-$2500 used because they are still considered huge moneymakers to businesses.&#xA0; Now I have one, and it didn&#x2019;t cost me an arm and a leg.&#xD;&#xD;And the cabinet is perfect for it.&#xA0; I like that I&#x2019;ve kept the cabinet Tron-themed, but upgraded it to run as a Class of &#x2019;81 arcade, so that I&#x2019;ll actually spend lots of time playing it.&#xA0; In fact, I&#x2019;ve been on vacation all week, and I&#x2019;ve been playing it for several hours each day ;-)&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
