    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Yup - I woke up Saturday to find the message above when I visited my website.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ve used Primus (Planet Domain) for the past 8 years as a hosting provider, and I&#x2019;ve never had any issues whatsoever - including reaching my bandwidth cap.&#xD;&#xD;For starters, I was a little concerned.....so I logged into my cpanel and checked out the AWSTATS first:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Holy crap!&#xA0; Did I just get too much traffic this month?&#xA0; I have been doing a lot of linking to my site from twitter for Game On 2.0 at the Ontario Science Centre....&#xD;&#xD;So I decided to view the day-by-day bandwidth:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;I just had a massive surge in bandwidth between Friday and Saturday!&#xA0; Was this a denial of service attack (DoS) of some type?&#xA0; I decided to check who was hitting my website by looking at what page(s) they were getting, and I noticed it was all the same page:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Basically, that&#x2019;s a page describing the famous &#x201C;no fire cheat&#x201D; mystery of the arcade game Galaga.&#xA0; So next, I have to see who is hitting me - was it random hosts (e.g. a distributed DoS attack), or a referral from some website?&#xA0; When I checked the latest visitors, I found that nearly all of the hits came as referrals from a post on Friday night from Reddit.com:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;So, I checked out the post and found a link to my web page in the comment section alongside people saying that they couldn&#x2019;t get to it:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;So, basically, someone linked to a blog post of mine from Reddit, and because it went viral on Reddit, it used up all of my bandwidth in less than 3 hours!&#xA0; Wow.&#xA0; That&#x2019;s a first for me.&#xD;I&#x2019;m not mad at all - after all, I WANT people to link to my pages and enjoy my posts.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Worse yet, Primus (Planet Domain) doesn&#x2019;t offer an unlimited bandwidth plan I can upgrade to, so I made the decision to switch to GoDaddy (which has been awesome for our triOS Dev Blog) - it basically costs the same, but has more storage and unlimited bandwidth.....and faster performance too!&#xA0; Plus, GoDaddy has amazing 24/7 customer support.&#xA0; As a result, you will see my post at the bottom of the picture above telling people where they can see this post ;-)&#xD;&#xD;Nothing against Primus - they&#x2019;ve been great for the past many years.......but I don&#x2019;t want a simple Reddit link (or otherwise) to use up all my monthly bandwidth and lock me out.&#xA0; And today, that is getting more and more possible than ever before....&#xA0;&#xA0; GoDaddy, here I come!&#xD;&#xD;For those who want to see my content before I&#x2019;m able to transfer the jasoneckert.net domain to GoDaddy, I&#x2019;ve uploaded it to my site on &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://jasoneckert.triosdevblog01.ca/"&gt;http://jasoneckert.triosdevblog01.ca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; (a GoDaddy site).&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
