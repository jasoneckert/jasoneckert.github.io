    <richText>&lt;b&gt;If you&#x2019;ve read my previous post, you&#x2019;ll know that I scored a working 1980 Pac-man cocktail arcade table in amazing condition, and that I&#x2019;m working on restoring every little part of it so that it will easily last another 33 years.&#xD;&#xD;Here is a quick recap of what I did in my last post: I took everything out of the arcade, redid the inside in yellow enamel, polished up all of the latches/braces, restored the metal grilles, as well as re-mounted the PCB, grilles and latches/braces again.&#xD;&#xD;Since the last post, I&#x2019;ve completely disassembled and cleaned the entire coin door assembly.&#xA0; I then re-coated it, polished up all silver metal components, re-assembled it and bolted it back into place.&#xA0; I also scrubbed the 25 cent plexiglass insert, and cleaned the plastic coin mechanism.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Following this, I disassembled the metal control panels joysticks - there were a few rust spots near the rubber diaphragm and control panel lip, so I sanded those down and re-coated all of the metal parts, cleaned the plastic parts and reassembled them again.&#xA0; The leaf switches and vinyl contact ball were in excellent shape, so I didn&#x2019;t need to replace anything there.&#xA0; And I also polished up the joystick shafts (which are made of copper as you can see below).&#xA0; The only thing that you&#x2019;ll notice in the finished picture (bottom right below) is that I have to replace the black t-molding.&#xA0; T-molding is really cheap (39 cents per foot), but I just have to find the time to get up to the Playdium Store in Toronto to get some ;-)&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The next thing I did was replace the 115VAC fan at the bottom.&#xA0; The old fan was working fine, but was pretty gunky when I took it apart - so I ended up buying a brand new one, and I&#x2019;m glad I did because the new one has better air flow and looks great as shown to the right.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Since these fans just connect directly to the&#xA0; A/C power, I thought that it would be good to mount a power drop (with breaker and surge protection) in the unused part of the case near the speaker and plug in the fan to it.&#xA0; I can then plug in the CRT isolation transformer and PCB isolation transformer to it as well (which is very clean and &#x201C;just makes sense&#x201D;).&#xA0;&#xA0; This is what the inside looks at this stage:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The only thing remaining to do now is re-add the wiring (after cleaning it), transformers (which I already cleaned up - see my isolation transformer in the picture to the right), fuses, and CRT monitor.&#xA0; It may seem like a lot of work, but it will actually be quite easy - I&#x2019;m going to use plastic spiral wrap tubing on the wiring bundles so it looks nice and clean and make sure they are secured to the case using new cable fasteners.&#xD;&#xD;Then, I&#x2019;ll turn it on and play some Pac-man for several hours ;-)&#xD;&#xD;Stay tuned for Part 3, where I showcase the finished arcade!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
