    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Probably the most iconic video game in history is Pac-man (Space Invaders and Super Mario Bros. are both close seconds).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;And Pac-man arcades are hard to find since many people want them.&#xA0; I was very lucky this past week since I managed to find someone selling a 1980 original Pac-man arcade cocktail table.&#xA0; The guy sold it cheap because he thought the CRT monitor was dead (it just needed re-adjusting).&#xD;&#xD;As an arcade collector I know it is very difficult to find a 33-year old arcade in great condition, but this is a good example of one - there was no water damage or nicks/gouges in the wood.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s even harder to find one that has pristine control panels with the original overlays in tact - but this one has them:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Even the metal plate under the top lip is in great condition as shown to the right.&#xA0; The only visible wear was the paint under the top glass - part of the instructions protrude beyond the wood part, so people used keys to scratch some of the paint off.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s barely noticeable, and I think I&#x2019;m going to leave it as-is because it is nice to have some battle-marks on any vintage arcade to show that it has been used in a real environment.&#xD;&#xD;Now, lets see what the inside looks like:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The inside definitely doesn&#x2019;t look as nice as the outside.....but for a 33-year-old arcade machine, you have to expect a bit of dust and dirt inside.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;So what should you do with a cool piece of history that is a bit dirty and dusty?&#xD;Restore it, of course!&#xD;&#xD;First things first, I removed pretty much everything inside the machine after carefully documenting and labeling each item.&#xA0; This includes the wiring, PCB, speaker, grills, coin door, metal latches, CRT monitor, and so on.&#xA0; A few things of note - the control panels are in excellent shape and have the nice metal joysticks that use a rubber diaphragm for smooth movement.&#xA0; There are only a few very small rust spots near the rubber diaphragm that I&#x2019;ll take care of later:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Also, the PCB is in immaculate condition for its age -&#xA0; I especially love the PAC-MAN label in the middle:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The coin door has a few rust spots on it - I&#x2019;ll take care of those as well as chrome up all metal parts in it.&#xA0; Similarly, there is some rust in the grill spacers and metal dings that I&#x2019;ll also need to take care of:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;OK - so after removing everything, I vacuumed out the dust in the cabinet, and patched any holes from screws (mostly used for cable tie-downs) as well as any spacers in the plywood layers (just to be perfect) - this is what it looks like at this stage:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Next, I put four very light coats of yellow high-gloss enamel on every part of the inside of the cabinet - this will make it easier to see components as well as preserve the wood for another 30 years.&#xA0; By the way, it had to be yellow.....after all.....what would you expect inside a Pac-man?:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Next, I used black matte enamel on the edges and control panel bases.&#xA0; Now, it&#x2019;s time to re-add the PCB brackets (which I cleaned in hot soapy water), the PCB itself, as well as the sanded and re-coated/polished grills, latches and metal braces:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;That&#x2019;s it for Part 1 of the restoration - next up, I&#x2019;ll be cleaning up and re-adding the wiring, speaker, fan, coin door, control panels and monitor.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ll also replace the t-molding on the control panel assembly too.&#xA0; Stay tuned!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
