    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Yes - you read that correctly - I&#x2019;m surprisingly impressed with a 10 year old desktop computer.&#xA0; Mind you, it&#x2019;s a 10 year old desktop computer that cost over $16,000 ;-)&#xD;&#xD;Long story short, I scored a free SGI Fuel computer along with the SGI Origin 300 computer I described two posts ago.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;But the SGI Fuel is a much more &#x201C;usable&#x201D; computer because it is a powerful single-processor graphical desktop computer (what Silicon Graphics was best known for).&#xA0; It has 4GB RAM, a 600MHz R14000A MIPS CPU, two SCSI hard disks and a very powerful Odyssey video card (DVI) that takes up the entire bottom of the cabinet.&#xA0; And it runs IRIX 6.5 UNIX.&#xD;&#xD;To the right is a picture of the case.&#xD;It&#x2019;s far larger and heavier than a standard desktop PC case.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;And no, it&#x2019;s not pink......it&#x2019;s fuchsia ;-)&#xD;&#xD;Below is a picture of the inside with the side panel removed (the Odyssey video card is the big component at the bottom of the case):&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;You may be thinking &#x201C;600MHz CPU?&#x201D; - but that CPU is totally badass because it is actually a MIPS CPU with a 5 stage core pipeline.&#xA0; Compared to a 20+ stage pipeline in Intel CPUs, it is roughly comparable to a 2.4GHz Intel CPU with just the pipeline alone.&#xA0; Add in the fact that the MIPS CPU architecture doesn&#x2019;t have any baggage in it&#x2019;s high-performance pipeline, and the end result is that it performs far faster than that!&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;How fast?&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Well, the picture at the very top of this post is my desktop on the SGI Fuel.&#xA0; You&#x2019;ll notice that I&#x2019;m running Blender (a graphics program) - it&#x2019;s the one with the Cartman model loaded from South Park.&#xA0; Let me just say this:&#xA0;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; this SGI fuel runs Blender much FASTER than my new Alienware laptop with it&#x2019;s Intel Core i7 CPU!&#xA0; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&#xD;Suddenly, I don&#x2019;t care too much about it being 10 years old.&#xA0; I&#x2019;m using it to do all my Blender models from now on ;-)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
