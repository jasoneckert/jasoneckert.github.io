                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="Body">If you asked me why I collect arcades, I’d probably say something like “it’s fun” and “it allows me to relax “ and “it allows me to think about things easily” and “it keeps my mind focused and sharp” and then I’d probably get frustrated because it’s near impossible to describe why I collect arcades......and tell you to just watch this video of Molly Atkinson because I identify perfectly with her reasons for collecting pinball machines (just replace “pinball” with “arcade” in my case): <a onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="http://vimeo.com/60632624" href="http://vimeo.com/60632624" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;">http://vimeo.com/60632624</a> <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">And while there are some people that I’ve met in the arcade community that are very similar to myself (and Molly), the arcade community is much more varied.  This is probably because you can get arcade machines much cheaper today than you can get pinball machines, so there is a much larger group of people who buy them.  And yes, some of them are pretty weird ;-)<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I recently read Rob O’Hara's book &quot;Invading Spaces: A Beginner’s Guide to Collecting Arcade Games&quot; (2008), and he describes a few arcade collector stereotypes in one of his chapters, so I thought it would be fun to expand on this list with the help from some CGCC (Classic Game Collectors Canada) forum members. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">So here is the expanded list of different arcade collector stereotypes for you to enjoy (I’m more of a combination of Molly, #3, and #6).<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><span class="style_1">1. The Opportunist</span> – Often only have 1 or 2 arcades, but believe they can pay for their kid’s university education by selling them.  Their machines are continually listed on Kijiji for several years and they wonder why no one replies. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><span class="style_1">2. The Player</span> – These collectors are in it to play the games with their buddies. Who needs an Xbox when you have arcades?  They often have several arcades, do little-to-no work on them because they regularly trade or sell them in order to get new ones and keep things fresh. Consequently, they usually own a pickup truck and have a garage. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><span class="style_1">3. The Professional Player </span>– These collectors often have a few games that they play incredibly well and could probably beat the Twin Galaxies record if they wanted to.  They play hard and often, and tune their machines for the gameplay.  It isn’t uncommon for them to have a spare PCB just in case there are problems with the current one, and they’ll drop some serious coin on parts if they need to.  A true vidiot. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><span class="style_1">4. The Hoarder </span>– These collectors have a LOT of arcades that they rarely play. Quantity over quality is the general idea here, so don’t expect too many popular games, or games that are in good condition. They could be on a future reality TV show... <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><span class="style_1">5. The Hacker </span>– These collectors buy whatever they can get cheap, and Frankenstein or mod the crap out of it.  For these people, an Asteroids cab with a Pengo bezel and NeoGeo marquee running a 60-in-1 board alongside an LCD monitor they found in the garbage is a beautiful thing. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><span class="style_1">6. The Restoration Expert</span> – These collectors often have popular arcade games (e.g. Pac-man, Defender, etc.), and get their kicks out of stripping them down and restoring them to their former glory inside and out. They usually have a big workshop, and end up selling the machine some time after restoring it for a fair price in order to fund the next restoration project. These guys are the absolute best people to buy an arcade from if you have the money. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><span class="style_1">7. The Worshipper </span>– These collectors often buy popular arcade games in bad shape for little money, and spend years trying to keep them as original as possible.  They typically don’t play their arcades, since they are “collector items.”  As a result, the machines get turned on only for a few moments when friends come over, but are quickly turned off in case the additional stress causes the power supply, PCB or monitor to die. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><span class="style_1">8. The Multicader </span>– These collectors often buy a single nice arcade cabinet (or fix one up), and throw in a nice multicade board (e.g. a 412-in-1) or a good MAME PC and JPac board. Drilling a few extra holes for the additional buttons in the original control panel doesn’t bother them because they just want a nice arcade machine that plays a ton of games for their kids, themselves, and when friends and family come over. They may also do one up for a friend or family member too, but you won’t find a ton of machines in their home. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><span class="style_1"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="Body"><span class="style_1">9. The Multicade Entrepreneur</span> – To fund other purchases, these collectors often buy a bunch of old arcade cabinets in any condition, Windex them, throw in a 60-in-1 multicade PCB, and sell them to others. There’s darn good money to be made doing this (depending on your area). NOTE: There is also a category of collectors who can be described as &quot;Jealous of The Multicade Entrepreneur&quot; <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><span class="style_1">10. The Shady Re-seller / Ambulance Chaser </span>- More interested in money over the hobby, trying to troll-flip-steal-lie their way around true players/collectors. No integrity. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><span class="style_1">11. The Underprivileged Player </span>– Like #2 (The Player), these collectors are in it to play the games with their buddies and often have several arcades. However, they do little-to-no work on them primarily because they have limited repair skills. They often buy junk, hoping that it will be gold, and don't own a truck or have a garage. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="Body"><span class="style_1">12. The Eternal Optimist </span>- These collectors acquire cheap &quot;fixer-uppers&quot; of their favorite games and all the parts to restore them. However, they don't actually have any time to actually restore or play them. Plus, they usually don't own a pickup or van, since that would simply mean drowning in 4 times as many projects...</p>
