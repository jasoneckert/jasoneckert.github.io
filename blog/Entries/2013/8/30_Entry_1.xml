    <richText>&lt;b&gt;All good things must come to an end.....and unfortunately this also applies to the Game On 2.0 exhibition at the Ontario Science Centre, which ran for the past 6 months (starting March 9th).&#xA0; This Labour Day weekend is the final time that you can check it out as it closes Sept 2nd.&#xD;&#xD;Our college (triOS College) was the presenting sponsor for the exhibition, which, for me was incredible - not only because I run our video game program, created the information for our game development booth, gave numerous Ontario Science Centre talks on gaming topics, and helped organize various game-themed events - but because I&#x2019;m an avid retro gamer who has many of the same arcade machines and vintage consoles showcased in Game On 2.0 in my own home!&#xA0; For me, it was like merging my home and work lives. I could actually bring my personal passion and knowledge of retro gaming into my day job!&#xA0; Not many people can say that.&#xD;&#xD;Better yet, I got the privilege to meet and work with some absolutely amazing people from the Ontario Science Centre!&#xA0; I can&#x2019;t express in words how genuinely wonderful these people were.&#xA0; The same goes for Barry Hitchings from the Barbican (the guru curator of Game On 2.0) - I&#x2019;ve never met anyone with more technical knowledge of video games, and I doubt I ever will.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Just like the Missile Command pic at the top of this post, I guess this is The End - but I&#x2019;m incredibly grateful for being a part of Game On 2.0.....these past 6 months have been both crazy and awesome, and an experience I&#x2019;ll always remember!&#xA0; Below are some random fun pics I pulled from the past 6 months and some commentary:&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;But the #1 thing that I&#x2019;ll miss about going to the Ontario Science Centre is definitely the Starbucks coffee and poutine:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
