    <richText>&lt;b&gt;The &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pianocade&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://pianocade.com/"&gt;http://pianocade.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;) is a chiptune synthesizer and MIDI controller made in Canada.&#xA0; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chiptune&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; is essentially music from the 8-bit era of computing and video games (typically the early 1980s to early 1990s), when music was developed using 8-bit waveform components and vintage sound chips such as the Atari POKEY or MOS SID.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Chiptune is very common in both music and popular culture.&#xA0; Many Techno, Electro, Dubstep, and even Pop musicians incorporate chiptune into their music today, and the raw synthesizer-like feel to most chiptune works equally well in music from the past (I wish someone would do a chiptune mashup of Tangerine Dream).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Many people today identify with the 8-bit music found in their favorite arcade games (e.g. Galaga, Pac-man, Donkey Kong) and home video games (e.g. Super Mario Bros, Zelda, Tetris).&#xA0; Consequently, the arcade controls and overall visual theme of the Pianocade (pictured at the top of this post) are very fitting!&#xA0; But let&#x2019;s examine it in more depth....&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The unboxing:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opening the box is actually always the coolest part of playing with any new gadget ;-)&#xD;&#xD;The Pianocade sits at the bottom of the long cardboard Pianocade box, and on top of it you&#x2019;ll find the power supply in its own box (which also contains the adhesive metal serial number plate that you can affix anywhere you like), a small note that directs you to github for the manual and design/source.... &#xD;&#xD;....and three whole pages of large Pianocade decals in themes such as Nintendo, Galaxian, Capcom, Ms. Pac-man, Pac-man, Donkey Kong, Centipede, Pong, and Space Invaders.......how cool is that?!?&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;By the way, the Pianocade shown at the top of this post is actually sitting on my 1978 Space Invaders arcade table.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The hardware:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Immediately after opening it, you&#x2019;ll notice that the build quality is far better than you would normally get with a mass-produced instrument.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Both the upper and lower parts of the case are entirely metal.&#xA0; They are held together with 12 screws (two on each side and 8 along the bottom), and thick enough to support the arcade hardware properly - you don&#x2019;t feel as if you are going to break or warp the body at all if you put pressure on any of the buttons or joystick.&#xA0; Very solid.&#xA0; And the upper part has a very attractive slant to it.&#xD;&#xD;It doesn&#x2019;t feel very heavy for it&#x2019;s size, and has two guitar strap mounts on either side so that you can use it as a keytar.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The ports are at the back of the device, and include the standard power, USB (which can be used to upgrade the firmware), MIDI, phone, and line ports, as well as a very large protruding on/volume knob.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;At first I thought this was overkill, but it protrudes just enough that you don&#x2019;t have to bend over to adjust while it is on a desk or when you are wearing it as a keytar, and the clear plastic knob with recessed numbers makes the settings extremely easy to see from any angle......so much so, that it was quite obviously a careful design consideration.&#xD;&#xD;In fact, the amount of detail that went into the placement and functions of buttons will be apparent when I review its functionality later on in this post.&#xA0; For now, I can tell you that the external build is beautiful and detailed - even the two insert coin buttons have Pianocade branding as shown to the right:&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Teardown:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;When you undo the 12 screws, the upper and lower decks come apart easily (you have to apply a little pressure when putting them back together to ensure that the screw holes line up properly).&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;On the inside, you&#x2019;ll find that no cheap components were used.&#xA0; The buttons are genuine &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suzo-Happ&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; (not the cheap Chinese knockoffs), and the joystick is a replacement Nintendo arcade joystick with the vertical metal mount.&#xA0;&#xA0; Better yet, the cables are not soldered to the microswitches on each button and the joystick, so you could replace a worn microswitch easily.&#xA0; Since the buttons and joystick are standard arcade components, you could easily replace them with other ones (different color/style) by simply unscrewing them from the bottom.&#xA0; Similarly, the speaker is connected via bolts and could easily be replaced.&#xD;&#xD;The &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;printed circuit board (PCB)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; is red with Pianocade labeling, and is affixed to the back of the case using the port mounts about a centimeter from the bottom so that you don&#x2019;t have to worry about damaging it if it is bumped while using it as a keytar.&#xA0;&#xA0; On the other side of the PCB, you&#x2019;ll find the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amtel 90USB646-AU 8-bit RISC CPU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; that makes it a genuine 8-bit machine ;-)&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&#xD;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The usage and sound:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Surprisingly, the Pianocade has a very small learning curve - I was able to figure out almost everything before looking at the manual.&#xA0;&#xA0; The black and white buttons function just like piano keys - however, the more buttons you hold, the more &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;arpeggiator effects &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;are added.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Moving the joystick up and down does the same &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;pitch bend&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; you&#x2019;d expect from a pitch wheel on a synthesizer, and moving the joystick left and right shifts one octave down or up respectively.&#xD;&#xD;The Player 1, 2, 3, and 4 buttons change the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;sound bank&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; used, and can be used in any combination of one to four buttons to access the full set of sound banks (15 of them).&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Of course, it isn&#x2019;t as versatile as a Moog, but the sound banks chosen are incredibly attractive and cover pretty much any chiptune application.&#xA0; You want something that sounds like the Mario coin sound?&#xA0; It&#x2019;s there. I should also add that these buttons are well placed at the front of the Pianocade - you can use your left hand to switch the sound bank quickly while your right hand is on the keyboard.&#xD;&#xD;If you hold the left coin button and move the joystick left/right, you&#x2019;ll change the speed of the arpeggiator effects. You can cycle through the available arpeggiatos by pressing the left coin button and the Player 1 button. The right coin button holds the current note (until you press both coin buttons).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Pianocade is a chiptune instrument - you don&#x2019;t have to fiddle with old technologies like LittleSoundDJ on an old GameBoy to get chiptune effects.&#xA0; This makes it very attractive to people like game developers who want to get some chiptune into their game, or chiptune musicians, who don&#x2019;t want to take a bunch of devices to a gig.&#xA0; The Pianocade can fit almost all of your chiptune needs in fine arcade style!&#xA0; It&#x2019;s also the only arcade-themed thing that my teenage daughter actually likes (she hates my arcade machines).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;I&#x2019;ll be showcasing this particular Pianocade at the upcoming Game On 2.0 exhibition at the Ontario Science Centre (March 9th - Sept 2nd) in a video game development capacity (8-bit inspired video games are definitely popular again on many platforms, such as mobile, where great gameplay trumps great graphics).&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
