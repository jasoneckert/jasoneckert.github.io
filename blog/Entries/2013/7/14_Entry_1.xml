    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I had a somewhat long conversation over coffee with a game developer yesterday that I met a year ago.&#xA0; He is young and naive, with a tremendous amount of skill at what he does for a very large game company in Ontario (hmmm...can you guess which one?).&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;We share a common love for arcades and retro games, and we&#x2019;ve learned a lot from each other over the past year.&#xA0; However, yesterday&#x2019;s conversation got skewed towards mobile games (something his company isn&#x2019;t well known for).&#xA0; He was quite confident that mobile games have reached their plateau, saturated the mobile marketplaces, and will decline and eventually disappear in much the same way the American arcade did in the 1990s.&#xD;&#xD;Ah ha!&#xA0; A debate worth of a few more coffees.....and it was on like Donkey Kong!&#xD;&#xD;I&#x2019;m not a big fan of generalization.&#xA0; Everything in the world is too complex to generalize with a few simple statements.&#xA0; But people love simple explanations for complex things - they like to blame XXXX for XXXX (e.g. blame video games for societal violence, or blame guns for gang shootings).&#xA0; I prefer to dwell on complex topics and change my view of them over time as I learn more about them.&#xA0; There&#x2019;s not a lot of comforting closure in this approach, but it&#x2019;s how I roll.&#xD;&#xD;That being said, when it comes to picking apart an argument, the macro perspective (which is essentially generalization) is often the best way to either prove or disprove certain points.&#xD;&#xD;So, let&#x2019;s do that with mobile games, which are essentially games that are played on mobile device platforms.&#xA0; If we look at game platforms from a historical perspective, we can see four distinct phases in their lifecycle:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	1.	&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Novelty&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; - The platform is new, and the technological novelty draws players and developers to it.&#xA0; During this phase, lots of games flood the market.&#x2028;&#xD;	2.	&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Refinement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; - The platform has been popular for a little while, and developers are looking at ways to refine their approach to games to keep players engaged.&#xA0; The platform receives a lot of formal analysis at this stage (fan magazines, formal discussion by game developers, etc.)&#x2028;&#xD;	3.	&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maturity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; - After refinement, developers begin to understand the key ingredients in taking full advantage of the platform itself, and use this information to develop more complex games (lots of creativity and diversity here, as well as plenty of idea copying ;-)&#x2028;&#xD;	4.	&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evolution or extinction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; - This is where a platform either gets replaced by another gaming platform (due to technological advancement) or keeps pace with technological development (maintaining the maturity stage).&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are really four major gaming platforms that we can draw from historically: home consoles, computers, arcade and mobile.&#xA0; Let&#x2019;s see how some key games from the past several decades fit into this mold:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Of course, this is a generalization - there are plenty of other games and platforms not listed, as well as several victims from along the way (remember the Atari Jaguar or TurboGrafx-16?).&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;From the chart above, you&#x2019;ll notice that home consoles and computers have lasted the longest, and are currently reinventing themselves as game platforms all the time.&#xA0; Arcade machines died out when home consoles became just as powerful, and having kids hang out in public places became less acceptable.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;So where do mobile games fit in?&#xA0; Well, they are very new.&#xA0; Did you have a smartphone 10 years ago that could play cool games?&#xA0; Nope.&#xA0; But you probably have one now, and there are a ton of games available for it.&#xA0; I&#x2019;m going to argue that mobile games are still in the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;novelty&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; stage, and that they are just beginning to find their way into the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;refinement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; stage.&#xA0; We are starting to see this with games like Candy Crush, where developers have taken key mobile game features that we&#x2019;ve learned over the last few years and used them to refine Bejeweled into a more popular, more addictive and more monetized game.&#xA0; And we&#x2019;ll probably start to see a lot more of this as the markets get bigger and more saturated. &#xD;&#xD;I argue that mobile games are far from dead, and that the saturation we are seeing is a transforming one - that we&#x2019;ll start to see the mobile marketplace get more complex, more advanced, and more mainstream.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;I also think we&#x2019;ll see more universally-available games.&#xA0; In other words, we&#x2019;ll see games that you can play on three different platforms (e.g. iOS, Android, Windows Phone) become far more common than games that can only be played on one platform.&#xA0; We are already starting to see this push with the rise of cross-platform development engines (e.g. Unity).&#xD;&#xD;As the mobile game industry gets more refined, I also think we&#x2019;ll see more categorization and hype surrounding mobile games.&#xA0; Right now, there are incredibly few mobile game fan sites, magazines, info sites, and bloggers.&#xA0; In other words, the mobile gaming community doesn&#x2019;t really exist in a formal way like PC and console gaming communities.&#xA0; I think we&#x2019;ll start to see this change very soon, and as this happens, we&#x2019;ll see the mobile gaming fragment into categories that follow specific game genres somewhat.&#xA0; Overall, I think this will add a tremendous amount of structure to the mobile game space that will serve to both guide developers and players into the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;maturity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; stage.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Like game consoles and computers, mobile devices have a large amount of staying power - in other words, they are likely going to be with us in 20 years.&#xA0; The workforce is becoming more mobile, school kids are becoming more mobile. and elderly generations are becoming more mobile.&#xA0; It makes perfect sense that games will stay on that platform, and will get better adapted for that platform as time progresses.&#xD;&#xD;OK - so if this generalized macro approach to disproving the argument that &#x201C;mobile games are dead&#x201D; doesn&#x2019;t bode well with you, then simply try the micro approach:&#xA0; The mobile marketplace is a very complex beast - no single factor led to its evolution and no single factor is likely to lead to its death.&#xA0; By that logic, it will take a long time to die (if ever).&#xD;&#xD;Now off I must go to play a dead platform for a few hours:&#xA0; a Galaga machine.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
