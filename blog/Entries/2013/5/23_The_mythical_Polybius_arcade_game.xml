    <richText>&lt;b&gt;There is an urban legend in game circles that started back in the arcade era.&#xA0; It goes something like this:&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new Tempest-like arcade game called Polybius appeared in several suburbs of Portland, Oregon in 1981 and quickly became crazy popular.&#xA0; However, the game had weird subliminal messages embedded in the graphics that caused unpleasant side effects in its players - amnesia, insomnia, nightmares, and suicide.&#xA0; Men in black suits often watched players and collected data and eventually removed all traces of the machines.&#xA0; The game was supposedly created by Ed Rotberg for a company called Sinnesloschen, and housed in a Pac-man style cabinet that was black.&#xA0; The men in black were supposedly secret government agents.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;So......is this a crude hoax or something with roots in reality?&#xA0; It doesn&#x2019;t take much effort to pick it apart.....&#xD;&#xD;Ed Rotberg was the guy who created Atari Battlezone.&#xA0; Battlezone which was such a good tank simulator, that the U.S. Military contracted Atari to build a version for their own simulator use.&#xA0; Because of this well-known connection, Ed would be a somewhat believable part of a Polybius hoax.&#xA0; The only problem?&#xA0; Ed himself says that he has never been involved in such a game.&#xD;&#xD;People during the video game craze of the 1980s were very worried about the addictive effects of video games - U.S. society agreed that they were warping our minds!&#xA0; So why not make a hoax about a video game specifically designed to warp our minds?&#xD;&#xD;Cathode ray tube (TV) displays have been known to cause epileptic seizures because electrons are &#x201C;painted&#x201D; across its surface at rapid intervals (this is why you see moving lines when you take a video of something on a TV).&#xA0; Boom!&#xA0; Seizures, nightmares, and other bad stuff that video games can do to add to the hoax.&#xA0; And if you were to think of a video game in the 1980s that epileptics should avoid, it would probably be Tempest, with its incredibly cool and fast-moving vector graphics.&#xA0; So why not make the Polybius game similar to Tempest in the hoax?&#xD;&#xD;So.....on the surface, Polybius seems like a crude hoax created from convenient tidbits of information.&#xA0; But why would people perpetuate this hoax?&#xA0; Probably because it&#x2019;s fun.....after all, people like government conspiracy theories.&#xA0; That&#x2019;s why the TV show &#x201C;The X-Files&#x201D; and movies such as &#x201C;Men in Black&#x201D; were so popular....we want to believe there is something spooky and full of conspiracy with the stuff we experience in everyday life.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s really no different than why we like to read fantasy novels, read comic books or watch movies.&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;And since people like video games, creating a conspiracy/mystery surrounding a video game is exciting.&#xA0; That&#x2019;s essentially the plot of the movie &#x201C;Cloak &amp; Dagger&#x201D; (1984).&#xA0; And movies like &#x201C;Tron&#x201D; (1982), &#x201C;War Games&#x201D; (1983), &#x201C;The Last Starfighter&#x201D; (1984) and &#x201C;The Lawnmower Man&#x201D; (1992) are not too far off the mark.&#xA0; Even &#x201C;The Simpsons&#x201D; payed homage to Polybius as shown below - take a careful note of the front of the arcade (Property of U.S. Government):&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;And there is plenty of cool fan art about Polybius on the Internet:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;So, enjoy the Polybius hoax!&#xA0; I&#x2019;m sure there will be a movie about it one day......&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
