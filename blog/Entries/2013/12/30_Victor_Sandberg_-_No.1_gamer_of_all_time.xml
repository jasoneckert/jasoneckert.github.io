    <richText>&lt;b&gt;In March of this year, Victor Sandberg from Sweden played Missile Command for 56 hours straight and beat the previous world record set by Victor Ali in 1982.&#xA0; His score was 81,796,035 points, which was just a bit higher than Ali&#x2019;s score of 80,364,995.&#xD;&#xD;And he did it LIVE on the Internet for the whole world to see on TwitchTV.&#xD;&#xD;This past weekend, Victor did it again LIVE on TwitchTV, only this time, he set 3 bigger goals for himself:&#xD;1)  Reach 100 million points&#xD;2)  Reach level 10,000&#x2028;3)  Play over 100 hours on a single credit&#x2028;&#xD;Before reaching any of his goals, one of the TwitchTV announcers said that Victor&#x2019;s marathon already had half a million views, and was easily the most viewed high score record attempt thus far.&#xD;&#xD;Just before midnight last night, Victor reached his first goal, and within an hour later, he reached his second goal.&#xA0; However, at about 3AM this morning, he found that he had miscalculated his bonus cities and lost the game (he said &#x201C;OK, I die&#x201D; and chuckled with satisfaction).&#xA0; He finished 71 hours and 41 minutes after he started with 103,809,990 points (10 points shy of getting the 176 city bonus, which would have allowed him to continue much longer).&#xA0; He completed 10,432 levels and went through 40 killscreens!&#xD;&#xD;And of course, I watched large/key sections of it, participated in the commentary, and had a blast.&#xD;&#xD;For those who have never played Missile Command, you can learn how the game is played by checking out the &#x201C;gameplay&#x201D; tab at &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://missilecommand.info/"&gt;http://missilecommand.info/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xD;&#xD;Essentially, Missile Command was a huge hit during the arcade era of the early 1980s, and heart of the Cold War.&#xA0; It requires that you defend 6 cities against an endless advance of ballistic nuclear missiles by shooting them out of the sky from three different anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defense bases called Alpha (left), Delta (middle) and Omega (right).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The game never ends, is entirely unpredictable, and is incredibly difficult to master - you have to think very quick to predict missile descent and plan ABM trajectories, as well as have the eye-hand coordination to actually carry out the defense!&#xA0; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Of all the games from the arcade era, Missile Command stands out as the one that was clearly more difficult than the rest.&#xA0; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other games, such as Pac-man, Donkey Kong and Galaga also require mental acuity to master, but they require it at a much more relaxed level compared to the intense pressure presented by Missile Command - for Missile Command, you only have a split second to perform the mental calculations needed to direct your ABMs throughout each level.&#xA0; In retrospect, this was one of the reasons Missile Command was a hit in the arcades of the 80s - its thrilling gameplay got your heart pumping and mind racing.&#xA0; An avid arcade gamer myself, I still rate Missile Command today as &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;the classic arcade game that requires the most mental and physical skill&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xD;&#xD;Most pro Missile Command players rely on the fact that ABM explosions close to each other result in a larger overall explosion - they then use this to create an &#x201C;explosion spread&#x201D; as high as possible to catch the various waves of missile attacks towards the cities.&#xA0; Since ABMs fired from the Delta base are quicker than those from the Alpha or Omega bases, most pros fire several shots from the Alpha or Omega bases to create explosion spreads and pick off anything that gets by using the Delta base.&#xD;&#xD;But Victor has a different strategy - his shots are almost all precision-based, and he doesn't rely on explosion spreads.&#xA0; More specifically, he only moves in the lower half of the screen in order to have time to predict missile formation, and mentally calculate their trajectories so that he can plan the fewest number of shots that will take out all of the missiles in each attack wave (since some trajectories will intersect).&#xA0;&#xA0; This means that he saves most of his missiles for the last wave of the attack, which is harder, but could lose a city if a low-flying plane suddenly drops a bunch of missiles over cities on the other side of the screen, or a missile splits off into other missiles on the other side of the screen.&#xA0; He uses his Delta and Omega bases evenly for most shots and reserves the Alpha base for close shots or planes (or wastes it on a smartbomb if needed). And he starts each stage with his crosshairs on the same spot in the middle of the screen for consistency (near the P in the word &#x201C;Points" that flashes on the screen before each stage begins).&#xD;&#xD;Victor&#x2019;s strategy is very similar to that of Tony Temple, who holds the world record of 4,472,570 for Missile Command under Tournament Settings (no bonus cities allowed).&#xA0; But Victor adds the dimension of long endurance by playing under Marathon Settings, which allows bonus cities, so the game could technically go on forever.&#xD;&#xD;In summary, not only is Victor extremely skilled at the most intense arcade game of all time, but he retained his mental and physical precision for almost 3 days straight and 103 million points!&#xA0; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Essentially, marathons are all about physical endurance, and Missile Command is all about mental acuity and physical precision - if you put these together and add Victor Sandberg, you&#x2019;ve got the most impressive gaming feat the world has ever seen!&#xA0; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&#xD;And I feel incredibly privileged to have had the opportunity to witness it.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
