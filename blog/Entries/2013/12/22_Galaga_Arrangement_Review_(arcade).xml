    <richText>&lt;b&gt;If you&#x2019;ve read some of my previous posts, you probably know that I&#x2019;m a Galaga freak - I absolutely love that arcade game.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ve got 3 Galaga arcade games in my rec room, including the ultra cool &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Namco Ms.Pac-man/Galaga Class of &#x2019;81 version&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xD;&#xD;The only version of Galaga that I haven&#x2019;t played up until this past week was the Galaga Arrangement version available on the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Namco Classic Collection (Volume 1) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;arcade board from 1995.&#xA0; These arcade boards are hard to find since they are still actively used, and if you can find them, they are well over $200 (sometimes much more).&#xD;&#xD;Luckily, I found one of these arcade boards (shown above) at an incredibly low price from Gilchrist Games (the oldest arcade vendor in Canada) and popped it into my 2-player Dynamo cabinet (for which this particular game was designed).&#xD;&#xD;The Namco Classic Collection (Volume 1) allows you to play the original or arrangement (remake) versions of either Galaga, Xevious, or Mappy.&#xA0; You simply select the game as shown to the left, and you&#x2019;ll then be prompted to select either the original or arrangement version.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;So, how is the Galaga arrangement version?&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;Firstly, it allows 2 players to play the game simultaneously!&#xA0; In fact, it&#x2019;s the only version of Galaga that allows 2-player simultaneous gameplay.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Secondly, it allows you to continue if you die by inserting another credit.&#xA0; By 1995, this was a standard feature at arcades because people in the 1990s didn&#x2019;t want to spend more money practicing to get good at a game - however, they&#x2019;d easily spend more money if they were allowed to continue from where they left off.&#xD;&#xD;These two things are the most important general features of the game itself, but there are plenty of features related to the gameplay.&#xA0; In general, the game looks and feels just like the original &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://galaga.org/"&gt;Galaga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, but has some key differences:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	&#x2022;	It has better graphics and sound (including background images and soundtracks).&#xD;	&#x2022;	Each stage is given a name, and there are exactly 30 stages in total.&#xD;	&#x2022;	The last stage is the final boss stage where you have to defeat King Galaspark&#xA0; as shown to the right (this stage alone is definitely a quarter-sucker).&#xD;	&#x2022;	After you defeat the final boss, the game ends (like most games from the 90s).&#xD;	&#x2022;	When you get captured by a Boss Galaga and then free your ship, you don&#x2019;t get double ships - instead, you get enhanced firepower.&#xD;	&#x2022;	There are 3 different types of Boss Galaga - each one gives you a different type of enhanced firepower (widespread wave shots, fast-shoot bullets, and spread shots).&#xA0; If you get captured again afterwards, the Boss Galaga simply steals away your extra firepower.&#xD;	&#x2022;	The player 1 ship is the traditional Galaga ship (white &amp; red), but the player 2 ship uses a green &amp; blue color scheme to differentiate it.&#xA0; Plus, the last ship to start/continue is positioned slightly above the other in order to make both ships easy to see.&#xA0; &#xD;	&#x2022;	There are enemy Galaga that look like sea mines (spiky balls) - if you hit one of these, they explode and take out any other enemy Galaga around them too!&#xD;	&#x2022;	The Galaga formations are incredibly varied, and very visually appealing.&#xD;	&#x2022;	Challenging stages are freaking hard, and the background rotates periodically and zooms in and out to make you feel as if you are rotating through space in 3D.&#xA0; Plus, later challenging stages are modified if you have 2 players playing so that both players have a series of Galaga to shoot.&#xD;	&#x2022;	There is a shot summary screen after each stage (not just challenging stages) - if you are playing 2-player, WIN is displayed next to the player who did better, and LOSE is displayed next to the player who didn&#x2019;t.&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Definitely a fun game!&#xA0; I can see why Namco released it, however, it didn&#x2019;t do incredibly well in the arcade scene of the mid 1990s, because most people wanted to play fighting games (e.g. Street Fighter II) or the big simulation games (e.g. Star Wars Episode 1).&#xA0;&#xA0; It wasn&#x2019;t until Namco released their Namco Ms.Pac-man/Galaga Class of &#x2019;81 arcade in 2000 (which retained the continue feature), when they were able to capitalize on their retro games.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
