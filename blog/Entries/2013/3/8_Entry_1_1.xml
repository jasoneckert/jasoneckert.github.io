    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Although the Game ON 2.0 exhibition opens to the public tomorrow, I&#x2019;ve been at the Ontario Science Centre setting up our part of the exhibition as well as attending the blogger preview and media events over the past two days.&#xA0; In this post, I want to get you excited.....so excited, that you will HAVE to go.....&#xD;&#xD;When you first walk into the exhibit, you&#x2019;re going to take a deep dive into ancient video game history.&#xA0; You&#x2019;ll see pinball machines, including a very rare Atari pinball (Atari only made a few pinball machines in the late 1970s, and they had very wide playfields).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;You&#x2019;ll also see an old Space War game, originally done on a DEC PDP-1 computer at MIT, and shown on a fancy &#x201C;arcade-like&#x201D; console with keyboard buttons :&#xD;&#xD;And.....oh wait.....they have a DEC PDP-1 computer too! They also have a punchcard terminal, as well as both versions of the earliest commercial arcade game (Computer Space), which was inspired by Space War and created by Nolan Bushnell:&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Nolan Bushnell later went on to form Atari and create Pong (you can play it on the projector using the controls on the podium):&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;In fact, Nintendo&#x2019;s first home game console wasn&#x2019;t the NES, it was an orange Pong clone from the 1970s:&#xD;&#xD;And, where would we be without the game that popularized video games worldwide and started the Golden Age of Video Games...... that&#x2019;s right, Space Invaders..... the game that chewed up $2 billion in quarters within a few years and caused a coin shortage.&#xA0; However, like all games in the exhibition, this one is set to free play:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;You&#x2019;ll see a plethora of vintage game consoles and PCs, loaded with some awesome games that you can play on the ORIGINAL controllers!&#xA0; It almost seems as if this section goes on forever.....I&#x2019;d have to take hundreds of photos to capture it all!&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;You&#x2019;ll also see a big section that showcases the huge history of portable gaming too - here is only one part of one of the exhibits (many of them are interactive too!):&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The walls are adorned with video game concept sketches, art, game posters, popular culture artifacts, and even a life-sized Lara Croft, who we caught checking out Chris (games can be sexist you know....):&#xD;&#xD;There are also big sections with sit-down driving games, music games, RPG games, and even virtual reality games.&#xA0; Below is a picture of Chris and Felicia next to the virtual reality sphere right after it was set up for the first time.&#xA0; The goggles are easy to put on, and the landscape around you moves only if you are in the sphere.&#xA0; Oh, and yes, you have a gun and can shoot things too....&#xD;&#xD;Of course, my favorite part of the exhibition is the arcade section (if you don&#x2019;t know why, just read my previous blog posts ;-)&#xD;&#xD;The machines are original in every way.&#xA0; They have the original electronics (the public doesn&#x2019;t get to see this - we were there when they were setting up, so we saw it).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;They are naturally worn and wonderfully musty smelling.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The decals and control panels show their original wear, and the lighting is arcade style (dim, to better see the screens).&#xD;&#xD;In short, visitors are going to get an absolutely authentic arcade experience!!!!&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;     &#xD;&#xD;Of course, I just had to roll over the Galaga arcade to 1 million points (had some onlookers by the end&#xA0; ;-) There was also some great live music from the renowned Toronto chiptune artist JeffTheWorld, who is actually using a GameBoy to create music below:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The even had Gamer Grub (4 flavors) and Space Invader themed cappuccinos (the Space Invader dissolves slowly in your cup):&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The bloggers and media people were equally amazing too - they really engaged with the exhibits.&#xA0; The two pictures below are Shaun Hatton from Electric Playground showing his megashaun bag, and a new blogger trio with an awesome name (3 Killa Bytes).&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
