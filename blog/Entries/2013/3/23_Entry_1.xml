    <richText>&lt;b&gt;The world&#x2019;s most famous microprocessor brand, the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intel Pentium&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, turned 20 years old yesterday!&#xA0; It was the famous successor to the Intel 486, and so people called the Pentium the &#x201C;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;586&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#x201D; for many years afterwards as a result.&#xA0; The first Pentium ran at 60MHz and was incredibly expensive - the right picture is my 60MHz Pentium, which I kept for purely nostalgic reasons.&#xD;&#xD;The Intel Pentium became a household term overnight partially because of Intel&#x2019;s aggressive marketing, but also because of timing.&#xD;&#xD;Intel plastered every PC that had a Pentium processor with a sticker that said something along the lines of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intel Inside - Pentium&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, and this practice continued with the word Pentium until only about 5 years ago, when the majority of Intel PC stickers switched to something like &#x201C;Core 2 Duo inside&#x201D; or&#xA0; &#x201C;Core i7 inside.&#x201D;&#xA0; And Intel made sure that there were plenty of magazine adverts and TV commercials to follow suit.&#xA0; But for about 15 years straight, the word &#x201C;Pentium&#x201D; was synonymous with &#x201C;PC&#x201D; for most people.&#xA0; And even today, people know what Pentium means. &#xD;&#xD;This past year, I ended up going to McDonalds to have a little fun:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cashier&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;: What can I get for you?&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;: I&#x2019;ll have a Pentium sandwich.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cashier&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&#xA0; I&#x2019;m sorry?&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&#xA0; A McBistro Chicken BLT please.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cashier&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;: The meal?&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&#xA0; No, just the sandwich please.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cashier&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;: Anything else?&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;: No thanks.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cashier&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;: That will be $5.86&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;: See?&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cashier&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;: Oh my god.....&#xD;&#xD;Timing was perhaps the biggest reason why the Pentium was successful - after all, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;it came out at the time when the PC business exploded and the Internet came to dominance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xA0; Although it was introduced March 22, 1993, it really never made its way into homes and businesses until about 1995, when Windows 95 was introduced.&#xA0; Windows 95 was a revolutionary new thing back then, and was many people&#x2019;s first computer.&#xA0; It also led to businesses moving towards computing like never before.&#xA0; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Windows 95 was the future, and you ran it on the Intel Pentium&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xD;&#xD;Of course, introducing the Pentium two years earlier in 1993 was a good thing, because there are always a few early adopters - usually businesses or academic institutions that have the need for a powerful workstation to serve a specific purpose and who are willing to pay a premium price for it.&#xA0;&#xA0; These early adopters managed to find the FDIV bug that was fixed by the time Windows 95 came out - you can read about the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;FDIV bug&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; here: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/F9614478-400B-4DC6-9B82-2F2337ACFCDF"&gt;&lt;click to read my blog post about the FDIV bug&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&#xD;I&#x2019;ll always consider the Pentium a pivotal point in computing history - it was the processor that powered the Internet revolution and became a household term.&#xA0; For us older geeks, we&#x2019;ll also remember it as the first processor that was important enough to have a name, and something that everyone with a 386 or 486 at home in the early 1990s secretly (or not so secretly) wanted to have ;-)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
