    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I&#x2019;ve been getting some heat over the past short while when I talk about my Galaga arcade, because there are 2 different camps when it comes to pronouncing the word Galaga.&#xA0; You can either emphasize the first syllable:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;GAL-a-ga&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;Or you can emphasize the second syllable:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;ga-LAG-a&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;I&#x2019;ve always emphasized the second syllable (ga-LAG-a).&#xA0; However, the Avengers movie came out this year, and Robert Downey Jr. (who plays Iron Man in the movie) pronounced the game as GAL-a-ga when it showed up in the movie.&#xA0; So now, most people say something along the lines of &#x201C;oh you mean GAL-a-ga&#x201D; when I mention my ga-LAG-a machine.&#xA0; Annoying as hell to say the least.....&#xD;&#xD;So I had to find out what the &#x201C;official&#x201D; pronunciation of Galaga was (I actually lost sleep over this stupid thing).&#xD;&#xD;An exhaustive search of the Internet turned up three things about the pronunciation of Galaga:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	1.	Namco doesn&#x2019;t give a damn about how it is pronounced.&#xD;	2.	There is roughly a 50/50 split between the two camps on Internet forums - with most acknowledging that they hear GAL-a-ga more often than ga-LAG-a.&#xD;	3.	Most videos on Youtube (even ones from the early 80s) pronounce it GAL-a-ga.&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;No answer there.&#xA0; So I thought for a while and came up with a good solution.&#xA0; Namco likely communicated using their preferred pronunciation of Galaga with Midway (the company who distributed the game in North America).&#xA0; So, if I could talk with someone who worked for Midway distributing Galaga machines back in 1981 and ask them how it was pronounced at the time, I&#x2019;d have a pretty reliable answer and could then put the issue to rest.&#xD;&#xD;The problem was a bit harder than I anticipated because:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	1.	1981 was a long time ago, and many of these people are dead or retired or senile.&#xD;	2.	Those who aren&#x2019;t dead or retired or senile, probably don&#x2019;t spend much time on the Internet.&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;After 2 weeks of searching arcade forums (and pinball forums), I found someone whose father (Walter Perks) was a Midway distributor for 4 states in the Southeastern U.S. from the late 1970s until the early 1990s.&#xA0; I got his number and called him at home.&#xA0; Long story short, he was a super nice guy, and not only gave me the answer I was looking for, but TOLD ME WHY!&#xA0; Awesome!&#xD;&#xD;The correct pronunciation of Galaga emphasizes the second syllable (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;ga-LAG-a&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;) for one simple reason - it was the direct successor to Galaxian (which was also pronounced with emphasis on the second syllable &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;ga-LAX-i-an&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;).&#xA0; He says everyone at Midway pronounced it that way from the time it was introduced on their channel sales call, and arcade operators did as well in order to keep related/similar games straight.&#xA0; However, he also mentioned that within a few years afterwards, the GAL-a-ga pronunciation became so popular among customers (for whatever reason) that most people started pronouncing it GAL-a-ga.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Good enough proof for me.&#xA0; I think it is best to pronounce it the original way: ga-LAG-a.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Plus, I&#x2019;m quite happy to have been pronouncing it the correct way my entire life.&#xA0; For those who have been pronouncing it as GAL-a-ga, I offer my sincere apologies ;-)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
