    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Yup - that is right - but bear with me, because it will take me some time to explain....&#xD;&#xD;Firstly, I&#x2019;m a big fan of video arcade games - I grew up in the 8-bit era of video games in the 1980s.&#xA0; They call it 8-bit because the printed circuit boards (PCBs) that contained the actual arcade game used an 8-bit CPU such as a Zilog Z80, Motorola 6809, or MOS 6502.&#xA0; These primitive CPUs are what generated the equally primitive graphics and gameplay that rocked 1980s arcades.&#xD;&#xD;Pac-man is no exception - it is defined by its &#x201C;cute&#x201D; simplicity and &#x201C;wocka wocka&#x201D; sound effects.&#xA0; Similarly, Galaga is defined by its straightforward and fun gameplay.&#xD;&#xD;In the 1980s, both Pac-man and Galaga were comprised of an arcade cabinet that held a monitor and controls that were connected to a PCB that had a &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zilog Z80 CPU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; (Galaga actually had 3 of these CPUs).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Over the 1980s, there were several 8-bit spin-offs of both Pac-man and Galaga (e.g. Ms Pac-man, Super Pac-man, Baby Pac-man, Pac-man Plus, Galaga 3, Galaga &#x2019;88, etc.).&#xA0; But by 1990, the fad had worn off, and people were interested in games that had more impressive 16-bit and 32-bit graphics.&#xD;&#xD;The funny thing is that both Pac-man and Galaga were still hot sellers during the 1990s in arcades because they were such great games - people who didn&#x2019;t like fancy video games still enjoyed them.&#xA0; And Namco (the company that made both games) sold more units.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Because of this, Namco released the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;20th Anniversary Edition Ms Pac-man/Galaga &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;arcade in 2001 (see picture to the right).&#xA0;&#xA0; It was very popular, and more importantly, it was true to its 8-bit roots since the PCB (shown below) ran a Zilog Z180 CPU.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The Zilog Z180 was simply a speed-enhanced Z80 - as a result, it could run the original 8-bit game code.&#xA0; All Namco had to do was write a bit of code to fill in the other functions, such as choosing whether to play Pac-man or Galaga.&#xA0; It made perfect sense from a development perspective, and it was still 8-bits in every way.&#xD;&#xD;Needless to say that the Ms Pac-man/Galaga arcade was wildly popular, and Namco followed up with a 25th Anniversary Edition 5 year later using almost the exact same PCB and Z180 CPU.&#xD;&#xD;However, that changed with the 30th Anniversary Editions this year.&#xA0; Namco released two arcades to celebrate their 30th Anniversary:&#xD;1) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pac-man Battle Royale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; - A four-player sit-down version of Pac-man (very cool).&#x2028;2) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pac-man Arcade Party (30th Anniversary Edition) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;- An arcade that had 12 Namco classics: Pac-man, Galaga, Pac-mania, Galaxian, Rally X, Mappy, Dig Dug, Xevious, Bosconian, Galaga &#x2019;88, Rolling Thunder, and Dragon Spirit&#x2028;&#xD;Naturally, chip nerds like me love to see what kind of guts are in the thing, but there was very little information available about either system.&#xA0; So, I resorted to the Internet.&#xA0; After long searching, I found an unboxing of Pac-man Battle Royale that showed the PCBs in the thing - they were definitely more complex than the single small Z180 PCB used previously, and there was a fan over the CPU!&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The problem is that the picture wasn&#x2019;t high enough resolution to read some of the chips.....dead end......until yesterday when I found someone on eBay selling a Pac-man Arcade Party PCB set pulled from a new arcade for $900 - and yes, there were some nice, hi-res photos in there that showed me enough of the chips that I could make out that two of them were Sony-branded CPUs and that the PCB was labelled &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Namco System147&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xA0; So I searched for System147, and ended up on a Japanese web site.&#xA0; Although Google&#x2019;s translate wasn&#x2019;t perfect, it clearly said that these systems used a smaller slimmed-down version of Namco&#x2019;s System246.&#xA0; Namco System246 is essentially the exact same hardware in a Sony Playstation 2, and was popular for some arcades in the early 2000s such as Tekken 4.  Moreover, it said that System147 was used for both Pac-man Battle Royale AND Pac-man Arcade Party arcades.&#xD;&#xD;Now, Namco System147 is much newer than 2000, so I imagined the hardware to be very similar to a Playstation 2 Slim (a later version released around 2005).&#xA0; I Googled a picture of the Playstation 2 Slim PCB and BAM!&#xA0; The chips were identical (by label and by size), and were in almost the same layout.&#xA0; The top two pics below are from the eBay listing for the Pac-man Arcade Party PCB, and the bottom one is from a modern Playstation 2:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;What that means is that under that cooling fan and blue silicon pad on the Pac-man Arcade Party PCB is a flat silver chip that is essentially the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sony Playstation 2 Emotion Engine CPU+GPU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; (on a single chip).&#xA0; And this chip is a &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;64-bit MIPS R5900 CPU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.......a far cry from the old 8-bit CPU of the Pac-man games up until now.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;However, it makes perfect sense for Namco to do this - the hardware is easy to produce, and the Playstation 2 development tools are easy to use to adapt the games to it.&#xD;&#xD;So the next time you are in an arcade and you see someone playing the latest Pac-man Arcade Party 30th Anniversary Edition game, raving about how they love 8-bit games, you can correct them and let them know that they are actually playing a 64-bit game ;-)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
