    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Today I attended the annual DIG conference.&#xA0; DIG stands for &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital, Interactive &amp; Gaming&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, and is essentially a large conference in London, Ontario that brings together the interactive, game, and digital media companies for both networking and educational/informative sessions.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Although this year&#x2019;s DIG conference was a bit smaller than last year, there were more industry professionals present, and far more meaningful conversation!&#xA0; Instead of the regular &#x201C;hello....what do you do....let&#x2019;s exchange business cards&#x201D; stuff that normally goes on at these conferences, I got plenty of time to actually have in-depth discussions with dozens of different app and game developers on what was working for them, what challenges they&#x2019;ve had, as well as their views on the industry and the future.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ve never enjoyed a conference more.....&#xD;&#xD;Perhaps this amazing networking was provoked by the keynote presentation, which was by far the best keynote presentation I&#x2019;ve ever attended.&#xA0; The keynote was given by &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don Daglow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, a 40-year veteran and pioneer of the game industry from San Francisco who has worked for companies such as EA, Broderbund, and Mattel (on Intellivision games).&#xA0; His presentation (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Insider&#x2019;s Guide to Going Indie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;) was a magical mix of entertainment, education, and motivation heavily related to the independent (indie) game industry.&#xA0; Here are some key things that I took away from Don&#x2019;s keynote:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	&#x2022;	In the past 40 years, there has been radical improvements in graphic quality within video games year after year.&#xA0; However, with the realistic graphics available in AAA game titles today, there is little room for major improvement.&#xA0; As a result, graphics are no longer a game developer&#x2019;s ticket to big sales.&#xA0;&#xA0; Instead, other features such as gameplay, storyline and social interactivity will likely be key features that make a video game competitive in the marketplace in the future.&#x2028;&#xD;	&#x2022;	Being an indie game developer is somewhat like being Indiana Jones - it&#x2019;s exciting, but they&#x2019;re constantly in trouble.&#xA0; In order to survive, you must do several things, including controlling costs (keep costs such as office space to a minimum and don&#x2019;t use personal guarantees with creditors), keeping a cash reserve for when it is needed, expecting and reacting to change quickly (change always happens faster than we expect), and thinking like a real marketer (rather than thinking like a game developer who &#x201C;thinks&#x201D; they understand how to market their game).&#x2028;&#xD;	&#x2022;	Game companies must think 5 years ahead all the time.&#xA0; Build franchises, not products, and make sure that you don&#x2019;t fall into the trap where you do a successful game....and then when sales decline, you realize you don&#x2019;t have the cash to make the next game...&#x2028;&#xD;	&#x2022;	Indie game development is mentally consuming.&#xA0; Don&#x2019;t let the intense focus of a project consume your personal life (family is more important).&#x2028;&#xD;	&#x2022;	Indie game development involves taking risks.&#xA0; Don&#x2019;t be afraid to take these risks.... just understand how to control them properly, and don&#x2019;t gamble with money you can&#x2019;t afford to lose!&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don&#x2019;s keynote gives excellent advice for indie game studios.&#xA0; Keep in mind that the indie game developer scene didn&#x2019;t exist 10 years ago - instead, you needed a big publisher company to bring a game to market - the publisher funded the development, marketed the game prior to release, checked legal requirements, manufactured the game media, distributed the game to retail stores, and so on.&#xA0; However, with the recent rise of Internet-based distribution (console and mobile games on app stores, PC games on Steam, etc.), game developers have the ability to create a game and bring it to market without spending a fortune or having a publisher.&#xA0; And, of course, the indie game scene is booming right now....&#xD;&#xD;However, in Ontario, many indie game companies don&#x2019;t last longer than a few years.&#xA0; Although there are a variety of different reasons for this, one large reason is that many of these companies were created to use up grant/startup money, and they fail to look at long term goals and revenue streams.&#xA0; Instead, they just hope for the best rather than aggressively plan to succeed (traditionally, the Canadian dream was to win the lottery so that everything worked out OK ;-)&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Those indie game companies that do succeed, usually adhere to Don&#x2019;s advice.....&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
