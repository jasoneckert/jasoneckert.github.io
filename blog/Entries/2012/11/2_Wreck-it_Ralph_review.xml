    <richText>&lt;b&gt;The Disney movie Wreck-it Ralph premiered today in the movie theaters, and I just had to see it ;-)  Overall, the movie definitely lives up to the hype this past year.&#xA0; Like all Disney animated movies, there is a plot with depth, a touching message, and plenty of humorous references.&#xD;&#xD;The best part of the movie for me was the large number of subtle references to various aspects of the video game industry (old and new).&#xA0; For example, the owner of the arcade (Litwak) wears a black-and-white striped referee shirt just like Walter Day (the founder of the famous Twin Galaxies organization that tracks arcade high scores (the character even looks like him too ;-).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;They also poke a lot of fun at the common features used within various video game genres.&#xA0; For example, in Sugar Rush, they have a mini-game that allows you to build your car as well as leaderboards.&#xA0; In Hero&#x2019;s Duty (a Halo-like first-person shooter game), characters have high-definition graphics, and the game itself has a stereotypical armageddon-style theme with military-style violence, guided navigation, mission complete sequences, and cheesy backstory (which they tie in all throughout the movie very well).&#xA0; And the Fix-it Felix game that contains Wreck-it Ralph is portrayed as a blocky 8-bit game from the early 1980s where characters only have one function and can only move in predefined ways.&#xD;&#xD;I also like that they featured some cool &#x201C;real&#x201D; video games from the arcade era of the early 1980s.&#xA0; The bar in the movie is actually the Tapper game (a real arcade game where you had to pour drinks for people).&#xA0; The place where the bad guys meet for their focus group is actually in the inner ghost chamber of Pac-man, and the &#x201C;homeless&#x201D; characters in the game are from Q*bert (which fits because Q*bert fell out of style long ago).&#xA0; There are also plenty of references to other games such as Mario, Burgertime, Paperboy, Joust, Frogger, Dig Dug, Qix, Sonic the Hedgehog, Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, and more!&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Disney definitely didn&#x2019;t skimp on portraying all of the different aspects of the arcade.&#xA0; The side art on the arcade allows Ralph to unravel the mystery of Sugar Rush in the movie.&#xA0; Plus, the movie talks about game glitches, the inner working of the game code,&#xA0;rebooting/resetting arcades to fix problems, and how the game characters die when the game is unplugged (which is true since old arcades are solid-state machines, and the characters loaded into memory are destroyed when the game is shut off).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Although most references in the game were arcade-related, some were generic to video gaming.&#xA0; For example, the lock to the code in Sugar Rush is actually a Nintendo NES controller, and there was a ton of modern player terminology (like on the sign in the picture at the top of this post: Will &#x201C;non player character&#x201D; in &#x201C;frames per second&#x201D; 4 food!).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;And I also have to mention the brief reference to Skrillex as the DJ at the party near the beginning of the movie ;-)&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;But my favorite part is near the end, when Wreck-it Ralph says &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;the gamers say we&#x2019;re &#x201C;retro&#x201D;....which I think means old but cool&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xA0; And at the end of the credits, half of the screen fills up with 8-bit junk and the movie crashes, just like the famous &#x201C;split-screen&#x201D; bug in Pac-man when you get to the 256th level........very cool Disney.......very cool ;-)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
