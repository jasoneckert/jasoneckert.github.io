    <richText>&lt;b&gt;In August, our Microsoft Student Partner (MSP) at the Kitchener campus (Mickey) organized a 3-day Hackathon for creating Windows 8 Metro apps and games using HTML5/Javascript (technically it&#x2019;s not called Metro anymore).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;It just took place this past weekend (Sept 7th - 9th), and was a huge undertaking for Mickey, but in the end it turned out amazingly well!&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The college was very good at coordinating the event (somewhat last minute because of a staff change), and Microsoft was incredibly generous - they provided a ton of food (Tim Hortons breakfast each day, and a big lunch each day), t-shirts, giveaways, prizes (Microsoft ArcTouch mice for the winners, and a Windows Phone for the GoDevMental draw). &#xD;&#xD;Microsoft even brought down a Windows 8 tablet for us to play with during the event, and we had a Kinect set up in the common area for people to play for reducing stress ;-)&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;On the Friday, Paul Laberge from Microsoft opened with an amazing presentation:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;For the rest of Friday, we separated into teams and moved to the classrooms to install Windows 8 and the dev tools, as well as start coding for Windows 8.&#xA0; On Saturday morning, people were waiting outside the mall entrance to get in and get back to work (after another awesome Microsoft-supplied breakfast of Tim Hortons, muffins and croissants).&#xA0; Ditto for Sunday too!&#xD;&#xD;In the end, people made some pretty awesome Windows 8 apps - we had a showcase at the end of Sunday in Room 15 and awarded four teams prizes of Microsoft ArcTouch mice (2 for best app, and 2 for best game).&#xA0;&#xA0; However, in my mind, everyone is really a winner!&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;I wish I could show pictures here of all of the apps and games, but my BlackBerry kept crashing after every couple of pictures, so here are a few of the apps and games that came out of the weekend:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Of course, I was there for the whole event - I didn&#x2019;t get the chance to participate, which is OK, since I wanted to ensure that things ran smoothly (I actually had to pick up the Tim Hortons each day - and when one of the coffee cambrios exploded, I quickly mopped up the mess and got a refill from Tim Hortons before the presentations started).&#xA0; I&#x2019;m just glad that I could support this awesome event and see everyone have so much fun developing apps and games!&#xA0;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
