    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I&#x2019;m a dean for a faculty that teaches video game development.&#xA0; What that means is that I&#x2019;m frequently talking about the video game industry at various events.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ve attended an unusually large number of events these past few months, and found myself addressing the subject of video game violence several times because someone brought it up.&#xA0; Until this past month, I thought that very few people still blamed video games for violent behavior in society.&#xA0; And if that is the case, I managed to meet those few who still think video games are evil.&#xD;&#xD;This post summarizes my viewpoints on video game violence and society, and is roughly what I say when someone brings up the subject.&#xA0;&#xA0; That being said, those people I talked to these past few months who thought that video games were evil didn&#x2019;t seem to acknowledge what I was saying, for whatever reason.&#xA0; Their mind was already made up, and nothing could change it. &#xD;&#xD;It isn&#x2019;t hard to point a finger at video games when it comes to violence - many video games that people play today (and historically) have demonstrated some sort of violence, whether it be blowing up enemy ships, killing zombies, or enemy soldiers.&#xD;&#xD;However, we must remind ourselves that &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;we live in a violent society&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xA0; It has been like that for all of human history, and isn&#x2019;t likely going to change anytime soon.&#xA0;&#xA0; If all video games were non-violent, then the video game industry probably wouldn&#x2019;t exist - people would search out other venues for entertainment that are more realistic within today&#x2019;s societal context.&#xA0; Remember that people play games for a variety of different reasons, and not simply because they are a novelty.&#xD;&#xD;I&#x2019;m a video game player myself, and have been for as long as I can remember - from video arcades, to home video game consoles, to PC and online games.&#xA0; Nearly everyone I grew up with plays video games, and I&#x2019;ve played video games with hundreds, perhaps even thousands of different people over the years.&#xA0; We are now affectionately called gamers.&#xD;&#xD;For gamers, the violence in video games is pure fantasy - &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;it&#x2019;s not real, and doesn&#x2019;t get translated into violence in the real world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xA0; There are some exceptions to this of course, but those crackpots could just as easily translate the violence from movies, television, or literature into the real world.&#xA0; Making video games non-violent won&#x2019;t prevent some crackpot from gunning down a theatre full of people - some people just snap.&#xA0; Sometimes, reality can suck.&#xD;&#xD;Many gamers I know primarily play games as a means to compete with other gamers.&#xA0; Others primarily play it for mental stimulation or to pass time in a mentally-stimulating way.&#xA0; Most people I know primarily play video games to blow off steam and relax.&#xA0; in a way, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;violent video games give people a way to vent frustration and anger in a non-harmful way&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xA0;&#xA0; This was one of the key reasons why youth of my generation spent time in video arcades, and why many people play violent video games today.&#xA0; Society can be stressful.&#xD;&#xD;Today, people of all ages play video games, and they have a &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;smorgasbord of game genres&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; to choose from (e.g. puzzle, adventure, social, educational, role-play, fantasy, sports, campaign, and shooter games).&#xA0; Plus, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;many games don&#x2019;t have violence at all&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xA0; Thus, people can choose to play video games to fill whatever need they need to fill.&#xA0; If they need to blow off steam, they&#x2019;ll likely choose a violent game.&#xA0; Alternatively, if they are looking for a mental challenge, they&#x2019;ll probably choose a game that doesn&#x2019;t have violence at all!&#xD;&#xD;It is also important to note that &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;video games don&#x2019;t teach us how to be violent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; - society and movies do an excellent job of that.&#xA0; Moreover, there is &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;no long-term impact &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;when blowing off steam by playing a violent video game - when the steam is gone, the player stops playing the game and moves on to something else.&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;So, in short, my take on video game violence is actually quite simple:&#xA0; Bring it, bitches!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
