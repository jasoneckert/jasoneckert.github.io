    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I was one of 50 people invited to Ubisoft&#x2019;s unveiling of their new state-of-the-art motion capture (mocap) studio in Toronto.&#xD;&#xD;I&#x2019;ve always been a big fan of Ubisoft games - I remember when Splinter Cell was released for the Xbox - I spent every waking minute of my spare time playing it.&#xA0; I loved the graphics, shading, storyline, stealth gameplay (quite frustrating at times).....everything.&#xA0;&#xA0; In fact, I love the whole Splinter Cell series.&#xA0; Best yet, this series is developed almost entirely at the Ubisoft Toronto studio right now.&#xD;&#xD;Ubisoft is located in a dingy area of Toronto, within an old factory building that doesn&#x2019;t look impressive on the outside.&#xA0; However, the inside of the building is spectacular.....including their latest addition - the very large mocap studio.&#xD;&#xD;Mocap uses a series of cameras to track the movement of key points on suits worn by human actors - this 3D data is then used to generate animated versions of the actors.&#xA0; Head masks with a front-facing camera capture facial movement and add to the realism. Here is a picture of some of the actors before their performance - the flash on my camera reflects off of parts of their suit, and you&#x2019;ll notice the front-facing camera on the headset worn by the actor on the right:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The actors gave a stellar performance, which was rendered in realtime on the large screen in front of us as shown in the pictures below:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;And, after a bit of retouching, the end result looks like:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Very cool indeed!&#xA0; But what does this mean for video games in general?&#xA0; Well, the studio director from Ubisoft put it beautifully - with technology like this, video game storytelling is much easier, and allows game studios to focus on performance-driven storytelling (where new and interesting experiences in the studio can be used to refine the game during development).&#xA0; In other words, richer content and more focus on the story rather than on the constraints of producing it.&#xA0; I need to get the next Splinter Cell when it&#x2019;s released.....&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
