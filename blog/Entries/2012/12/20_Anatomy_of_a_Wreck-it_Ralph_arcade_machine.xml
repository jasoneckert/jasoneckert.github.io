    <richText>&lt;b&gt;If you read my previous blog posts, you&#x2019;ll probably notice that I&#x2019;m a big fan of video games AND that I really like the retro video game themed movie that Disney released last month called Wreck-it Ralph.&#xD;&#xD;The main character in the movie is from a fictitious early 1980s arcade called Fix-it Felix Jr., and Disney created several &#x201C;real&#x201D; Fix-it Felix Jr. arcade machines (and a custom arcade game to go in it) to promote the movie earlier this year.&#xA0;&#xA0; I first saw one of these arcade machines back in August at the Toronto Fan Expo and was intrigued.&#xA0; The case looked just like a standard Nintendo cabinet from the early 80s, with new trim, a new joystick (not a good one), new buttons that had &#x201C;clicky&#x201D; microswiches under them (unlike the smooth leaf switches used in the 80s), new control panel art, new marquee art, new bezel art, and new side art.&#xA0; They even scratched up the side art and sanded some edges of the cabinet to look dirty and worn.&#xA0; You can see this in the pictures below from an eBay listing of one of the machines for sale after the movie was in theaters (note that in the first picture, you can see a real Nintendo joystick on the Mario Bros game next to Fix-it Felix Jr.): &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;To the average person, it looked totally authentic, but to me (an arcade freak), I knew that Disney probably bought a bunch of old Nintendo arcades, had them painted and re-trimmed, and controls replaced.&#xA0; Then they created new artwork (marquee, control panel, bezel, side art), applied it and roughed it up to look aged.&#xA0; The CRT monitor inside looked very crisp, so it was probably new, and Disney probably paid a game company to create a Fix-it Felix game that could run from a PC inside and connect to the arcade controls with a J-PAC or I-PAC card (the J-PAC is just an I-PAC with a JAMMA interface for easier connection to an arcade).&#xA0; These cards plug into the USB of the PC as well as the controls of the arcade, and allow you to map keyboard keystrokes to arcade controls - people who create classic arcade boxes with a PC inside running the MAME arcade emulator buy these things all the time.&#xD;&#xD;Of course, I couldn&#x2019;t open it up to confirm this last part.......until now.&#xA0;&#xA0; Someone posted a picture of the inside of a Fix-it Felix case on the Internet in Europe - note the cheap HP PC (the box to the right is for a Bronson++ US-to-European power converter for those who are curious):&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Better yet, someone in Canada bought one of these arcades from Disney, and is selling it on Kijiji (a classified ad site) - I asked her to send me some pictures of the inside and she sent me the scanned pages from the Disney manual that came with it, confirming pretty much everything I wanted to know - notice the same HP PC, and the use of a J-PAC (my commentary is in &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;red&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;):&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Also, a quick search of Youtube turned up a video showing the boot process of the machine, which starts with an HP Invent POST (startup) screen: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://youtu.be/lEF33s9AYOg"&gt;http://youtu.be/lEF33s9AYOg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&#xD;The HP PC probably loads a copy of Windows with the Windows boot screens replaced with a custom image (very easy to do), and the Fix-it Felix Jr. game is likely set to start immediately after boot in full-screen (also very easy to do).&#xD;&#xD;So.......why hasn&#x2019;t Disney released the same Fix-it Felix Jr. game for PC?&#xA0; They have slightly different versions of it for iOS, Android, and Flash (Web).......I&#x2019;m sure people would pay for a PC version.&#xA0;&#xA0; That way, they could create their own Fix-it Felix Jr. arcade at home by installing an old PC into an arcade cabinet and buying an I-PAC or J-PAC.&#xA0; And if Disney licensed the artwork for printing, people could make the arcade look exactly like in the movie.&#xA0; Definitely something I would do.&#xA0; Are you listening, Disney? :-)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
