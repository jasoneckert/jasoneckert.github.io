    <richText>&lt;b&gt;When Boing Boing linked to an article reviewing the book Invasion of the Space Invaders by Martin Amis (1982), I just had to peruse it (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.themillions.com/2012/02/the-arcades-project-martin-amis-guide-to-classic-video-games.html"&gt;http://www.themillions.com/2012/02/the-arcades-project-martin-amis-guide-to-classic-video-games.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;).&#xA0; This article describes the book as an amazing glimpse into 1982 with great illustrations, pictures, and an introduction by Steven Spielberg!&#xA0; Moreover, it is one of the most quoted books on video games ever.&#xA0; Better yet, Amis took it out of print and refuses to acknowledge its existence publicly....is he ashamed of it?&#xA0; That&#x2019;s always a sign of a great read.&#xD;&#xD;Come on.&#xA0; Admit it.&#xA0; After reading the article, you want to read the book too.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;I wanted to read it so bad, that I scoured the Internet to see if there was a scanned copy available.&#xA0; Eventually I saw a link on some forum to the PDF scans of it on Megaupload.....damn.&#xA0; Megaupload is no more.&#xD;&#xD;So, I searched for a used copy.&#xA0; eBay, Amazon, and most other online rare book retailers wanted almost $500 for a pristine copy, or $250 for a copy in bad condition.&#xA0; Double damn.&#xD;&#xD;Luckily, living in Canada has its benefits - people outside Canada don&#x2019;t like to buy from online Canadian retailers (thank you greedy Customs policies!).&#xA0; I managed to find a copy in almost brand new condition at a used bookstore in Ottawa for just over $100 shipped, and I poured through the book today.&#xD;&#xD;What an awesome read!!!!!&#xA0; It really is everything that the article said it was....plus more.&#xD;&#xD;The book contains 127 glossy 8.5x11&#x201D; pages chalked full of stunning illustrations, pictures, and commentary about video games from Martin Amis.&#xA0; The introduction by Steven Spielberg is short but well placed - he talked about his own addiction to Missile Command (there is a picture of him next to a Missile Command arcade machine in his office as shown below), and warns that video game addiction has &#x201C;happened to the best of us.&#x201D;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The book is divided into three sections.&#xA0; In the first section, Amis discusses the nature and rise of the video game industry, mostly from a personal standpoint.&#xA0; He details how the addiction gets started, and progresses until you find yourself telling people you are &#x201C;going out for a walk&#x201D; when you actually intend to sneak into the arcade for a few rounds of Defender.&#xA0; Then comes the bleeping sickness, where you can&#x2019;t sleep because you have video game music in your head.&#xA0; He sums up his addiction nicely near the beginning of the book:&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now, after nearly three years, the passion has not cooled.&#xA0; I don&#x2019;t see much of Space Invaders anymore, it&#x2019;s true - though we&#x2019;re still good friends.&#xA0; These days I fool around with a whole harem of newer, brasher machines.&#xA0; When I get bored with one of them, a younger replacement is always available.&#xA0; (I still spend the odd night with Space Invaders, my first love - just for old times&#x2019; sake.)&#xA0; The only trouble is, they take up all my time and all my money.&#xA0; And I can&#x2019;t seem to find any girlfriends.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;The best part about this section is how Amis captures the mentality of video-junkies, vidkids, and other kinds of video game addicts: Triffids, Invadees, skinheads, strolling bouncers in purple tuxes, swearing vandals, mohican punks, whacked-out kids on roller skates, ten-year-old monsters, queasy greasers, doddering hippies, and so on.&#xA0; He even goes on to describe what brings some of these stereotypes to the arcade and what types of games they are likely to play and why.&#xA0; Alongside the descriptions are immaculate pictures - my favorite is this one:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Many of the illustrations span two pages - such as this one of the Hall of Mirrors arcade:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;There are some great illustrations too - check out this illustration in the Asteroids section:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Moreover, Amis carefully places plenty of great quotes and snippets from events of the time in the first section - Sherry Turkle, Nolan Bushnell, Kurt Vonnegut , and so on.&#xA0; One of the coolest quotes I found was a quote from Steve Jobs (who then worked for Atari):&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#x201C;The computer,&#x201D; says Atari&#x2019;s Steve Jobs, &#x201C;is one of the pinnacles of Western rational thought.&#xA0; They bring together physics, electronics, chemistry and mathematics; they bring logic, and philosophy, information theory, all that.&#xA0; And the people working on these computers possess a passion about the discovery and creation of something.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s a passion that I have only seen matched in people pursuing what they consider to be the truth of their existence.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s the same purity of spirit I have experienced in monks.&#x201D;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;In section two, Amis covers 20 different video games:&#xA0; Space Invaders, Galaxian, Asteroids, PacMan, Defender, Scramble, Cosmic Alien, Lunar Lander, Battlezone, Missile Command, Gorf, Pleiads, Centipede, Frogger, Donkey Kong, Turbo, Video Hustler, Pro-Fold, Dribbling, and Tempest. He details what makes them good/bad from a player perspective using a ton of colorful and politically incorrect language that will make you laugh out loud - for example:&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Missile Command is a game of interception, Lunar Rescue of dodging, Pac-man of munch-accumulation (which perhaps explains why it is the only video game with any kind of following among women).&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;In addition to giving kick-ass advice for each game, he gives hundreds of specific techniques that can be used to beat the game - techniques that he has learned from spending an immense amount of time in arcades (and thousands of dollars). Here is but one small example from Defender:&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The safest way to rescue an airborne Humanoid is to position yourself near the top of the screen and fire in a single line:&#xA0; the rising Lander will levitate into your line of fire, then you scoot forward and catch his pack.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;For those of us who still play all of these retro games on our PCs using MAME (Multi Arcade Machine Emulator) and X-Arcade Tanksticks (real arcade controls), this advise is gold!&#xA0; I&#x2019;m already putting it to use and Amis was bang on!&#xD;&#xD;Better yet, the commentary on each game is both descriptive and stunning - a good example is the last paragraph in the Galaxian section:&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now, of course, in the bars of Paris (cheap and exotic drinks, pinball, space games&#x2014;heaven), the Galaxian machines themselves cringe unused in the corners, rejected, gestured at. How far away their proud dawn now seems! They are leaned on and eaten off, like any old Space Invader. People stub out butts on their screens. Everyone is playing Pac-man, or Defending. Soon the machines will be shipped off to some seaside arcade, to wait out their days&#x2014;slapped to pieces by children, their wires fizzing from the damp air, and dreaming of the great day in '79 when they invaded the space of the Space Invaders.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;In the third (and last) section, Amis discusses how video games have found their way into homes, and why these home video games suck royally compared to arcade video games (they really did at that time ;-).&#xA0; I found this section the least interesting, but Amis does a good job of being comprehensive - he covers every aspect of the home video game market from consoles, such as the Atari VCS, to portable handheld game systems, to PC video games (he even includes the complete BASIC source code to a few games).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;At the end of the book is a short quiz that tests your knowledge of various arcade characters, and a glossary of the terms used in the book.....many of which were coined by Amis himself.&#xA0; For example, zembla refers to a &#x201C;reformed video game addict.&#x201D;&#xA0; Perhaps that is what happened to Amis and why he doesn&#x2019;t want this book back in print.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s too bad, really, since this book is pure awesome.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
