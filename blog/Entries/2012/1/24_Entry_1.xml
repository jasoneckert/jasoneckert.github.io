    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I was born in the mid 1970s and grew up in the 1980s.&#xA0; I spent a lot of time playing video games, using home consoles such as the Atari 2600 and Nintendo NES, as well as spent a lot of time within video game arcades, playing the more impressive games for quarters. &#xD;&#xD;To my generation, video game arcades were awesome, addicting ways of spending time.&#xA0; The light-up displays, the interactivity (you were right next to the player beside you), the loud video game music, and the instant peer fame you received if you got the top score on the high score screen........it was totally awesome!&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The only bummer was when you ran out of quarters.&#xA0; I usually only had about $2 in quarters when I went to the arcade - sometimes I&#x2019;d have $10, and I remember a few times where I had a roll of $20 that I shared with my friends.&#xA0; Altogether, I must have spent many hundreds of dollars on arcades growing up.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;If you read my post last Thursday, you will know that I recently bought an original video arcade game called RAIDEN (which is Japanese for Lightning &amp; Thunder - Rai &amp; Den).&#xA0; RAIDEN was the coolest and most advanced game at the arcade I remember - a fast-paced flying shooter with amazing effects and sound.&#xA0; Nearly all game sites on the Internet consider the RAIDEN series (1990-2009) the best flying game series ever made!&#xD;&#xD;Now the great thing about owning a real arcade game is that you can open the coin drawer so that when you insert your quarters into the slot, they fall right back into your hand.&#xA0; Instead of loading up a game with a ton of quarters, you could simply use 1 quarter and put it in a ton of times.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;So I find myself today as an adult with the ability to play an unlimited number of games on a real arcade machine - real controls, real sound, real cabinet, real coin slots.....the real deal.&#xA0; I can&#x2019;t begin to describe how cool that is......but it gets better.&#xD;&#xD;On Saturday, my friend Matt came over (we actually played together in arcades when we were kids) and I powered it on.&#xA0; When he saw the screen, he shrieked (yes shrieked): &#x201C;Oh my God - I remember this game.&#xA0; Out of the way - I have to play it!&#x201D;&#xD;&#xD;So we played 2-player mode RAIDEN for over an hour and a half straight, inserting a ton of quarters between levels or when we ran out of credits.&#xA0; In the end, we probably put in about 200 quarters ($50 worth)........but we managed to do something we were never able to do as kids with the limited coinage we had back then: WE GOT PAST LEVEL 5.&#xA0; In fact, we got past all 8 levels of the game....twice!!!&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Once you get past all 8 levels of RAIDEN, it starts at the first level again, but the enemies are a lot faster/stronger and more intelligent (they were curving off and around the screen to sneak up behind us!).&#xA0; No worries......we just kept slamming that quarter in the machine again and again and eventually went through all 8 levels AGAIN (but in a harder mode).&#xD;&#xD;At that point, we decided to quit and enter in our high scores (I got just shy of 4 million, and Matt got 4.5 million).&#xA0; Our hands were sore (Matt&#x2019;s fingers were swollen), and we were sweating like crazy.&#xA0; Plus, we couldn&#x2019;t get the awesome music from the game out of our heads (the music was so good, I went out and got the soundtrack CD from the game - yes, there was a soundtrack ;-).&#xD;&#xD;And we want to do it again, for longer and get an even higher score (RAIDEN is the type of game you&#x2019;d never get tired of).&#xD;&#xD;It may sound cheesy to those who never grew up with video games, but I realized something that Saturday:&#xA0; I reached a new milestone in my life - a sort of self-actualization related to the goals of my youth.&#xA0; I achieved something that I would have never dreamed of in my youth, and enjoyed it just as much as I would have back then.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;If you loved to play arcade games in your youth, I highly recommend that you go out and buy a real arcade game that you had fond memories of as a kid, so that you can experience that same weird nostalgic self-actualization feeling.&#xA0;&#xA0; Don&#x2019;t worry - the games pay themselves off pretty quickly (mine has already paid itself off in free games in just over a week ;-)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
