    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I&#x2019;ve always wanted to restore an arcade video game.&#xA0; After all, I really enjoyed playing arcade games when I was growing up.&#xA0; So I scoped out some cool deals on Kijiji and picked one up.&#xA0; I had very strict criteria:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	1.	It had to be a game I really really liked playing when I was younger&#xD;	2.	It had to be in perfect working condition internally&#xD;	3.	The controls had to be in great shape&#xD;	4.	The game, electronics and CPU in it had to have some sort of neat value or be unusual in some way for its time (because I like to collect neat/rare computer systems) &#xD;	5.	It had to be relatively cheap (a few hundred bucks or so)&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Well, I found the machine I was looking for:&#xA0; An original &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;RAIDEN (1990)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; by Seibu Kaihatsu.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The picture at the top of this post is the inside of the game after the back panel was removed.&#xA0; The CRT monitor is held on by the brass chassis, and you can see the power supply and main circuit board at the bottom mounted to an angled piece of wood.&#xA0; It looks clean right now, but that is because I spent hours meticulously cleaning every part inside the game console, including the electronics.&#xD;&#xD;The game itself is pure awesomeness - it is a fast shooting scroller - imagine Galaga on massive steroids with a ton of different weapon types, dual player mode, and wicked sound (you can even buy the soundtrack to RAIDEN on CD or download it from their website).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Check out the ultimate laser blaster shown to the right:&#xD;&#xD;It is the type of game that I really enjoyed playing in video game arcades - I specifically remember losing a lot of quarters to this game and its sequels ;-)&#xD;&#xD;As for collectible value, RAIDEN was the most successful game franchise from Seibu - the latest version is RAIDEN IV for arcade and XBox 360 &#xD;(2009).&#xA0; So having the first RAIDEN game is pretty cool.&#xD;&#xD;However, the coolest thing about the game for me is its guts.&#xA0; Most arcade games of the time had a Motorola 68000 CPU for graphics and a Zilog Z80 CPU for the sound.&#xA0; Pretty much the same CPU in an old Macintosh.&#xA0; Nothing fancy.&#xD;&#xD;RAIDEN, on the other hand, has two 16-bit Sony CXQ70116P-10 CPUs, which are Intel 8086 CPUs running @ 10MHz (the fastest 8086 CPU ever made). &#xD;&#xD;Now that may not seem too special, but you may not realize that 8086 CPUs have always been extremely rare.&#xA0; They were so expensive to produce at the beginning of the PC era that almost no computers used them.&#xA0; Nearly all early PCs (including the original IBM PCs) used the much cheaper version of the Intel 8086 with an 8-bit bus called the Intel 8088.&#xA0; But the architecture that it implemented was the 8086 (or x86) architecture that eventually evolved into the Intel 80286, 80386, 80486, Pentium, Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, Pentium 4, Core Duo, Core 2 Duo and Core i3/i5/i7 CPUs we have today (all implement the x86 architecture).&#xD;&#xD;So this video game comes around with two of these puppies clocked at their highest speed. Tres cool.&#xD;&#xD;The sound system uses a third CPU (a Zilog Z80A) that interfaces to a Yamaha YM3812 digital sound generator &amp; OKI MSM6295 voice synthesis module.&#xA0; Chip nerds will notice that the YM3812 was used in the original Adlib and SoundBlaster PC sound cards.&#xD;&#xD;The outside of the cabinet has some nicks and scratches and needs some TLC, but that is relatively easy since the cabinet is made of wood and black veneer (the marquee is the only graphical part of the cabinet).&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The controls are in great condition and work perfectly - however I ripped off the worn plastic and blue vinyl base of the control deck as shown in the picture to the right.&#xA0; The control deck is a large metal section built into the case that contains the holes that the controls fit into (with extra holes for different controls if the game used in the case required it).&#xA0; After I remove all of the plastic and vinyl sticker crap, I&#x2019;ll cover the metal control deck with a nice smooth new layer of vinyl and remount the controls (it will look nice).&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;I figure this project will probably take me some free time here and there over the next few months - when it&#x2019;s done, I&#x2019;ll move it to a nice part of my rec room and play the crap out of it.&#xA0; Actually, I&#x2019;m playing the crap out of it right now....I beat my old high score already ;-)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
