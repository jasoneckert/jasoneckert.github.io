    <richText>&lt;b&gt;If you haven&#x2019;t seen the trailer for the upcoming Disney movie Wreck-it Ralph, check out this link: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COC8W8uLdI8"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COC8W8uLdI8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &#xD;&#xD;Once you have seen it, you&#x2019;ll know that it is a fun movie about video game characters, many of them from the golden age of video games (the 8-bit era).&#xA0; However, to get people excited about the movie, Disney decided to bring a little arcade game experience to the promotion of the movie......and they did an extremely good job of it!&#xD;&#xD;The game revolves around a fictitious game called &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fix It Felix Jr.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; made by a fictitious company called TobiKomi (which has a retro video game company ring to it).&#xA0; It is an obvious parody of Nintendo&#x2019;s Donkey Kong Jr. - even the cabinet and artwork has the same style as the Nintendo one.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;So Disney contracted a few game companies to create Fix It Felix Jr. games for the Web (Flash), iPhone/iPad, and even one that can be hosted in a real Nintendo arcade cabinet and placed next to their promotional posters at various events.&#xA0; The picture to the right is their arcade from the Fan Expo this year in Toronto.&#xD;&#xD;I can tell that different companies were used to create the games because they all play a bit differently when it comes to gameplay and graphics - the Web game is much harder to navigate than the iPhone/iPad game, and has a slightly different look.&#xA0; The arcade version is likely running on a PC inside the case and connected to the arcade controls via an i-Pac board (which connects arcade controls to the USB port on the PC and simulates keystrokes).&#xA0; Although the real arcade is visually impressive in every way, the game is a bit choppy and awkward compared to the iPhone/iPad version because it was developed in a relatively short period of time, and likely using an awkward PC dev platform.&#xA0; Still, the game is extremely playable and visually impressive - they kept very closely to the look, feel, and overall experience of an early 1980s arcade game (even the controls and cabinet are a bit worn just like a real arcade game):&#xD;&#xD;Regardless, Disney&#x2019;s choice to make a real arcade version is not only nostalgic for those of us who grew up in the 1980s, but cool for the kids as well, since it makes them feel part of the famous 8-bit era that was the dawn of the modern video game industry.&#xD;&#xD;Of course, I&#x2019;ll be seeing the movie the day it comes out ;-)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
