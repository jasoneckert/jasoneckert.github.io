                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style">What is 8-bit?<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">8-bit is really an era…….an era that spanned the late 1970s to the late 1980s.  It was the first era where computing and video games became part of people’s vocabulary, and in many cases, lifestyles.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Why was this era called 8-bit?<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">8-bit was the era where home computers and video games typically used early computer processor hardware that could only process small instructions at one time.  The computer chip that processed these instructions was called the Central Processing Unit (CPU), and the instructions processed were groups of binary numbers (0 or 1).  Each 0 or 1 was called a bit, and the first commercially available CPUs could process instructions that were only 8 bits long.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">The most common 8-bit CPUs of the time included the Intel 8088 (used in the original IBM PC), the Zilog Z80 (used in many early home computers such as the Tandy TRS-80, Sinclair ZX-81, and Osborne 1), and the MOS 6502 (used in the famous Apple II, Atari 400/800 and VCS, as well as the Commodore PET, VIC-20 and 64).  These same CPUs were also used to create the custom computer boards used within nearly all video arcade games.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">The defining features of 8-bit video games<br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 185px; width: 185px;  clear: left; float: left; height: 185px; margin: 12px 12px 12px 0px; position: relative; width: 185px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_2 inline-block stroke_0 shadow_0"><img src="10_8-bit_explained....and_why_it_is_important_files/droppedImage.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 185px; width: 185px; " /></div>The limitations of early 8-bit hardware also limited computer and video arcade game graphics – rather than being able to draw a character using smooth lines and vivid textures, 8-bit computers resorted to images created from combinations of colored blocks.<br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">However, this limitation did not prevent the creation of software and video games that displayed graphics.  It was just as awe-inspiring back in the early 1980s to see a blocky computer-generated Donkey Kong (as shown to the left) as it is today to see the stunningly-realistic graphics within modern games such as Assassin’s Creed.  Remember that 8-bit graphics were bleeding-edge at that time, and hey look – it’s a gorilla on the screen!  Totally radical!<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Today, 8-bit is often used in the context of video games, especially video games that were popular in video game arcades at the time (Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Asteroids, Centipede, Donkey Kong, Galaga, Frogger, etc.).<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">For video games, 8-bit hardware was also a limiting factor in the actual gameplay itself.  The complexity of many modern games would have been too difficult to implement back in the 8-bit era.  Instead, game makers had to create games that used simple-yet-addictive gameplay.  Games such as Pac-Man, where you had to guide a simple puck-like character around a maze on the screen to eat stuff and avoid ghosts was a massive hit because the gameplay was simple and addictive.  You could easily play it with friends in a bar while waiting for drinks, or in a movie theatre before the movie started.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Additionally, 8-bit video games required that the player demonstrate a great deal of physical skill (careful timing, good hand-eye coordination, and quick reflexes).  You had to position your ship in Galaga at just the right spot in order to shoot an entire wave of enemies in a challenge stage, and you had to hit the jump button at exactly the right moment to avoid getting killed by a barrel in Donkey Kong.  These skills had to be developed and refined over time…….often requiring many quarters/tokens ;-)   <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">There were video game competitions, and world record high scores were tracked from around the world by Walter Day’s famous Twin Galaxies organization.  To most kids growing up in the 1980s, it was more impressive to be the world champion at Asteroids than to get a gold medal in the Olympics.  Asteroids likely required more practice and physical skill ;-)<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Although <span class="style_1">blocky/pixelated images</span>, <span class="style_1">simple-yet-addictive gameplay</span>, and <span class="style_1">demonstration of physical skill</span> are the primary defining features of 8-bit video games, there are some other features that you will also find in most 8-bit video games.  For example, most 8-bit games had <span class="style_1">no definite ending</span> and allowed you to have <span class="style_1">unlimited ammo</span> (for shooting games such as Galaga).  They also had sounds effects and music that was synthesized from computer chips (often another CPU and a waveform generator chip) – this is commonly called chip music or <span class="style_1">chiptune</span> today.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">The rise of 8-bit today<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Fashion trends come back into style roughly every 30 years.  This may not be true of video games, but the timing is definitely close. In many of the larger cities in the U.S., bars and clubs with vintage arcade game themes (and games )have become popular in the last few years – Barcade, Insert Coins Videolounge Gamebar, Emporium Chicago, Underground Retrocade, ZAP Arcade, Rusty Quarters, and Ground Kontrol are some of the most famous.  They all host some of the most popular original arcade games of the 1970s and 1980s – after all, video game arcades of the 1970s and 1980s were places of social gathering too!<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Additionally, 8-bit is seen as an art form today.  There are many 8-bit visual artists who create art that incorporate 8-bit elements, or reflect on themes from the 8-bit era – you can find many of their pieces showcased at the iam8bit art gallery in Los Angeles.  Similarly, there are many 8-bit musicians who develop chiptune music using 8-bit waveform components and vintage sound chips such as the Atari POKEY or MOS SID.  Techno, Electro, and Dubstep musicians frequently incorporate 8-bit chiptune components into their music today.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction. (Sir Isaac Newton’s Third Law of Physics)<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">For the past decade, many best-selling games have focused on realistic graphics and gameplay.  Characters and landscapes look like they came out of a movie, and players themselves take on a more realistic position within the game itself.  Players must purchase/obtain item, ammo, health, and weapons, as well as keep track of their progress and interact with other players who may be on a different physical continent. In other words, the player is immersed in a whole different world with realistic graphics and rules, and plays alone with others across the Internet.  These games are designed to maximize the amount of time players spend in the game, and right now, the game market is saturated with games of this genre.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Many gamers today want something different – they seek games that don’t offer realistic graphics and gameplay – they seek fun/challenging games that can be played for either short or long periods of time, as well as games that can be played with friends in a social atmosphere.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">This would explain why 8-bit style graphics and addictive gameplay are gaining popularity today.  Indie games such as Fez and Minecraft are good examples of this – they offer simple-yet-fun gameplay, as well as abstract representations of real objects. In other words, many gamers today are saying we don’t need realism and complexity to have fun.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">It’s hip to be retro...<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Video games rose to fame in the 8-bit era.  In fact, the late 1970s to mid-1980s is often referred to as the golden age of arcade video games. 8-bit games today have a vintage flair, and a sense of historical greatness to them as a result.  After all, 8-bit was where it all started in the first place……..why not pay homage to it?<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Even some successful game franchises today, such as Mario Bros and Donkey Kong, date back from that era.  But it doesn’t stop there – the rise of Web and mobile gaming led to a refocus on games that had simple-yet-addictive gameplay, as well as graphics that were best suited for Web browsers and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.  Video games from the 8-bit era fit well into this space, and many of the vintage games from that time were re-released (or improved and re-released) for the Web and mobile platforms as a result.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Now, younger generations know what Pac-Man is, and enjoy playing some of the early 8-bit versions of Super Mario Bros.  Moreover, pictures and links related to 8-bit games litter social media sites today, such as Facebook, Google+, BoingBoing, 9gag, and Neatorama.  Even Disney is capitalizing on the 8-bit trend this year with the movie <span class="style_1">Wreck-it Ralph</span>, which stars many of the key video game characters from the 8-bit era.  After all, it’s hip to be retro now…...<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Where does it go from here?<br /></p>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="Body">Predicting the future is nearly impossible in the gaming world.  But one thing is for sure: 8-bit will always be represented in some form.  I doubt that arcade video games will ever infiltrate every bar, club, pizza parlor or corner store like they did in the golden age of arcade video games – especially since much of the hardware from that time is more than 30 years old now.  However, I think that the key features of 8-bit games – the blocky art, the awesome gameplay, and the physical challenges will be present in many games for the foreseeable future.  After all, Galaga (1981) is still my favorite game to play today!  What is yours?</p>
