    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Every so often I re-read a book that I read years ago to remember what it is about.&#xA0; Mostly, I re-read sci-fi or notable works such as Neuromancer (William Gibson) or The Hitchhiker&#x2019;s Guide to the Galaxy (Douglas Adams) since those are the types of books that I kept over the years. &#xD;&#xD;However, I kept a book from 1989 called &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Life with UNIX (Don Libes &amp; Sandy Ressler)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; that I remember using as a good UNIX reference a long time ago.&#xA0; While browsing the Net, I happened across a recent review of it that said it was &#x201C;a timeless book on everything UNIX &#x2013; 90% of it still applies today.&#x201D;&#xD;&#xD;So, I decided to re-read it.&#xA0; And boy, am I glad I did!&#xA0; It truly lives up to its title.&#xD;&#xD;Over half of the book teaches you UNIX structure, commands, programming, etc.&#xA0; I know all of that stuff already, but I read through it anyways because I was shocked at how well the authors communicated the information in an easy-to-understand way.&#xA0; I have written many textbooks on UNIX and Linux &#x2013; mastering UNIX and the ability to teach UNIX are two very different skill sets that are rarely seen together, and these authors have both.&#xD;&#xD;The rest of the book is the exciting part for me.&#xA0; The authors give a detailed account of UNIX history and introduce the main purpose of UNIX (&#x201C;the UNIX way&#x201D;), which is often overlooked in UNIX books:&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;UNIX is much more than such simplistic definitions.&#xA0; It is more than an operating system.&#xA0; It is a philosophy of programming. The main tenet is that the power of UNIX comes from the relations between the programs rather than the programs themselves.&#xA0; UNIX encourages one to take existing programs and combine them into a new, more useful program.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;Moreover, the authors enlighten us as to how the UNIX way developed &#x2013; the structure of UNIX was a result of its original desire to work on the DEC PDP-11:&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;However, the PDP-11 line was clearly based around a 16-bit address space.&#xA0; Because of this, all of he programs were limited to 64KB.&#xA0; Ironically, this emphasized the building of small programs.&#xA0; With the advent of pipes to support cooperating processes, and exec(), which supported program chaining, it was possible to build large systems by linking together several smaller utilities.&#xA0; This is a hallmark of UNIX programming, and it is possible that we have the restricted address space of the PDP-11 to thank for it.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;This book discusses how UNIX split into two streams:&#xA0; the BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) UNIX stream was the research arm of UNIX, while the AT&amp;T System V UNIX stream was the commercial arm that was licensed to hundreds of vendors.&#xA0; Moreover, since UNIX was easily ported to different hardware platforms, it became the first example of an &#x201C;open&#x201D; system:&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;UNIX is a wonderfully open system.&#xA0; Openness isn&#x2019;t something bestowed or permitted &#x2013; it is an attribute of the underlying architecture of a system.&#xA0; While many systems claim to be &#x201C;open,&#x201D; UNIX pioneered the concept even before the word was coined.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;As a result, UNIX proliferated in the 1980s.&#xA0;&#xA0; The U.S. Government and DARPA eventually went with UNIX because it was common in research fields at the time and because it was &#x201C;open&#x201D;, changes and improvements could be made without begging a proprietary vendor to do them.&#xA0; For software developers, it made you feel better to support and develop a system that is used on a wide range of the market, and hardware vendors preferred &#x201C;open&#x201D; systems like UNIX over the numerous proprietary systems out there in the 80s since there was more support. If you hired people, they likely knew UNIX.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;Now comes the really exciting part of the book: the authors speculate on the future of UNIX based on their knowledge of it in 1989.&#xA0;&#xA0; And like Nostradamus, they were bang on!&#xA0; Although they didn&#x2019;t foresee Linux, they predicted Mac OS X perfectly.&#xA0; Mac OS X is the world&#x2019;s most advanced OS today &#x2013; it has an amazing graphical interface that anyone can use, and under the hood the whole system is a BSD-like UNIX system derived from NeXTSTEP/OPENSTEP with a Mach UNIX kernel.&#xD;&#xD;These are some quotes from the book regarding UNIX in the future (from 1989):&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about the Apple Macintosh?&#xA0; Well, the Macintosh can hardly be called a competitor.&#xA0; Apple&#x2019;s A/UX operating system for the Mac II is UNIX with an Apple front-end.&#xA0; This could only help UNIX for the future.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mach is a modern version of UNIX.&#xA0; Mach was specifically designed to support multiprocessor and parallel computation while retaining the features of UNIX.&#xA0; With a completely rewritten kernel, Mach is potentially a UNIX for the next generation.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;If UNIX is to survive into the next decade, we are going to have to do something about its user interface. &#x2026;&#xA0; Undoubtedly, we will see implementations of Mac-like front-ends on top of UNIX systems.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;Although less impressive, the authors also predicted the proliferation of laptop computers and large computer networks such as the Internet:&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The future of portable systems seems clear.&#xA0; They will continue to decrease in price and weight.&#xA0; The will increase in power and functionality.&#xA0; Lastly, expected future increases in data transmission rates over dialup lines will provide portables with the ability to network with geographically distant LANs.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;What an amazing read.&#xA0; Complaints about this book should be redirected to /dev/null.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
