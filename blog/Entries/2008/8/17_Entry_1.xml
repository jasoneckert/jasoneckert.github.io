    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Just got back from Florida &amp; Disney World. Aside from the extreme heat, it was awesome!&#xD;&#xD;We went on lots of cool rides and saw tons of special effects at Hollywood Studios (stuff that blew up, caught on fire, etc).&#xA0; There were also some pretty cool movie props, such as the red ship they used in &#x201C;The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy&#x201D; to land on Vogsphere:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;There were too many great shows and rides to blog about here, but one that I would like to mention here is Epcot (Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow). &#xD;&#xD;Epcot is the famous large globe (shown to the left) that contains a ride that takes you through the history of human civilization and communication including the invention of language, the printing press, and the beginning of digital communication.&#xA0; Each scene contains recently-updated realistically-animated figures that depict the major turning points in human history.&#xD;&#xD;One cool thing I noticed is that Epcot chose a scene of Steve Wozniak in his garage in California inventing the Apple computer to represent the beginning of the Personal Computer revolution (see right).&#xA0; At the end of the ride, your pictures are automatically merged into an animated view of your future (based on the choices that you selected on the touchscreen during parts of the ride) and displayed on a cool 3D globe and surrounding room.&#xA0; Then your picture flies to the area of the world that you are from and becomes a white dot - these white dots identify where most Disney visitors are from (the day we went, nearly all Disney visitors were from Florida,&#xA0; the east coast of the US, Ontario and Quebec).&#xD;&#xD;On the day that I wore my t-shirt with the sudo Linux comic from Xkcd.com (&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/149/"&gt;http://xkcd.com/149/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;) a lot of people stopped me to comment on it and talk about Linux.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;And speaking of Linux, the video arcade in our resort actually had the game &#x201C;Tux Racer&#x201D;, which is an Open Source game that is installed by default on nearly all Linux distributions today (see left).&#xD;&#xD;We also saw lots of other stuff in Disney World such as a domestic dispute in our resort that had the Sheriff of Orange County called (they actually wear Sheriff badges like you can buy in Walmart), a shooting at the bus terminal in the Downtown Disney shopping district (they closed the whole area off for hours, so we had to walk to the other side to get a ride back to the resort), several Spanish families with hundreds of unsupervised children reenacting &#x201C;Lord of the Flies&#x201D;, a McDonalds that serves steak (the prices for food at McDonalds in Florida are about 50%-60% less than in Canada even though the CDN dollar is very close in value to the US dollar), and lots of scrub lizards on the sidewalks (we stopped counting them after 250).&#xA0; However, we saw the weirdest things when we visited the Virgin Records Superstore in Downtown Disney:&#xD;&#xD;1. You could buy a Hillary Clinton Voodoo Kit (with instructions, Hillary Clinton doll and pins as shown below).&#xD;2. You could buy any newly-released song on vinyl records (see below)!&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;I can understand the Hillary Clinton Voodoo Kit, but vinyl records?&#xA0; Come on people - even CDs are obsolete - put your music on an iPod!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
