    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Yes, I am definitely a CrackBerry user.&#xD;&#xD;As a result, when I saw a new book on Amazon called &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;CrackBerry: True Tales of BlackBerry Use and Abuse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, I simply had to order it and pay the inflated shipping and US exchange rate to have it delivered to Canada. And I am glad I did - it was a hilarious read, and I must admit that I can relate well to the crazy stories within.&#xD;&#xD;I like how the book points out that there is definitely an addictive aspect of BlackBerry devices that is not present in other smartphones.&#xA0; And I also agree that a big part of this addictive aspect is the speed at which you can check email on the BlackBerry - it is designed such that you can click twice to read the latest emails, and the OS never stops, it simply sleeps and awaits a click.&#xD;&#xD;I even did their BlackBerry Addition Quiz and scored 15 (which apparently maps to a strong BlackBerry addiction).&#xA0; Yes, I do check my BlackBerry at:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	&#x2022;	Stop lights (I just look at the title of new emails....it beats staring into the Abyss)&#xD;	&#x2022;	In the bathroom (checking RSS news feeds is better than a magazine)&#xD;	&#x2022;	While waiting in line (especially at grocery stores....I hate waiting at grocery stores)&#xD;	&#x2022;	At dinner (especially if the company is boring)&#xD;	&#x2022;	In public places (my daughter an I text each other in l33t at Starbucks for fun) &#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;And yes, I sometimes feel weird when I don&#x2019;t have my BlackBerry and have even experienced the &#x201C;phantom BlackBerry&#x201D; effect.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;However, I do these things when I feel like it, mainly to get a heads up on news or emails that I will need to reply or act on in the future (reading them early prepares me mentally and saves me a ton of time overall).&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Unlike other CrackBerry addicts, I have no problem leaving my BlackBerry at home during a trip, putting it away at dinner or special events, and turning it off for days at a time!&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;I also like to use it to piss off stupid people during meetings by ignoring them and typing on my BlackBerry when they are addressing me :-)&#xA0; It is a great tool for suffering fools!&#xD;&#xD;The BlackBerry is a great device, but it is simply a productivity tool that anyone can live without.&#xA0; The book is funny though, and has some good tips for those who are hopelessly addicted.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Afternote:&#xA0;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; At the time, this blog post upset some asshole at RIM.&#xA0; And since we had an educational agreement with them at the time (that was yet to be signed), they held this post over our heads and I was forced to put a login on my blog section until the agreement was signed).&#xA0; Why did they do it?&#xA0; Perhaps it was the emptiness of their cubicle-oppressed lifestyle that made them want to lash out and hurt others in order to validate their own existence.....we&#x2019;ll never know.&#xA0; Regardless, enjoy!&#xA0;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
