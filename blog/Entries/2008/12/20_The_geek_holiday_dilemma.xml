    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Ah yes, the holiday season is fast approaching.&#xA0; But for many geeks (who are better at buying RAM than thoughtful gifts for others), this time can be stressful.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The following is a story about this dilemma - I guess you could call it a Geek Tragedy.&#xD;&#xD;While at your computer one evening, you decide to do all your shopping online like last year - it is perfect - you don&#x2019;t have to go to crowded shopping malls, and you can get all of your shopping done in a single day as well as have it shipped to your place by the end of the next week.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The only downside (remembered from last year) is that 1 in every 2 boxes that arrive simply contain cool stuff that you buy for yourself online.&#xA0; Then you think, &#x201C;Maybe that happens to me because the first sites I think of going to are futureshop.ca, bestbuy.ca, tigerdirect.ca and canadacomputers.com.........damn.&#x201D; &#xD;&#xD;So then you decide to go shopping at malls like all the other sheeple in North America.&#xA0; After arriving at the mall, you note that getting through the parking lot is about as frustrating as nailing Jello to a tree.&#xA0; By the time you do get parked, the mall hallways are so packed with people that it is hard to find the stores you want to go to quickly.&#xA0; When you do get to a store, it is jammed full of people, which doesn&#x2019;t make walking through the 1.47 foot wide isles any easier.&#xA0; Can&#x2019;t stores sacrifice some of their product to make some more free space?&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;So after a while, you decide to try those new outdoor malls where there are lots of big outlet stores......like the big one off the 401 in Cambridge that has Futureshop, Bowrings, Old Navy, Roots, Walmart, Staples, Tommy Hilfiger, and a ton more.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; However, you realize that parking is about as difficult to navigate as at the mall......and although the isles are about 2.69 feet wide, there are more people filling them.&#xA0; So after stopping at McDonalds in Walmart for revitalization, you decide to wander through the Futureshop to brighten your whole shopping outlook.&#xA0; On good days, you can easily frolic through the isles at the Futureshop and look at lots of great stuff.......but when you enter the store, frolicing is obviously out of the question since every isle is crammed full of people......so you quickly buy some blank DVDs and get out of the place (you can never have too many blank DVDs).&#xD;&#xD;The whole experience leaves you feeling woozy and irritated (you can&#x2019;t count the number of screaming kids and associated screaming parents), so you go to get some Advil at the local Shoppers Drug Mart, only to realize at the checkout that they sell gift cards for about 50 different stores!&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;So you buy the Advil and gift cards and go home.&#xA0; Next year, you decide to buy everything online, and rename your computer Dionysus.&#xD;&#xD;The End.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
