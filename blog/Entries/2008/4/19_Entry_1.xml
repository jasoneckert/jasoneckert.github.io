    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Yes, it only took 3 months (during lunch hours), but Aaron and Peter got the SGI Octane to run Gentoo natively.&#xA0; The hell that they went through was a wonderful demonstration of &#x201C;sweat equity&#x201D; - a heavy combination of research and trial-and-error.&#xA0;&#xA0; After learning how to prepare the system and compile the necessary software including the kernel (the steps are in my March 15th blog entry), we realized that the latest kernel doesn&#x2019;t like the R12000 platform and there are no working patches to make it work. &#xD;&#xD;So.......Plan B was to directly image an SGI volume header from a known working MIPS Live CD, extract the kernel from it using dvhtool and copy it across the network for storage.&#xA0; Next, the Octane would be prepared as normal (a long process), but the known working kernel would be inserted into the SGI volume header instead of compiling the new kernel version.&#xA0; However, the arc.cf configuration file was custom made for the Live CD and it wouldn&#x2019;t boot the Gentoo system on the hard disk.&#xA0; It took quite a bit of trial-and-error to figure out how to confuse the new kernel to boot the Gentoo system on the first SCSI hard disk (/dev/sda1) - that was done this week, and the Octane natively boots Gentoo Linux.&#xD;&#xD;When you turn on the Octane, you will see the boot menu as shown below:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;By selecting Start System, the variables that we set in the NVRAM of the Octane will invoke the ARCload boot loader with the appropriate information about the SGI volume header and root partition as shown below:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;After the kernel loads (a few seconds), the Linux system will boot the Gentoo Linux system on the hard disk (notice the SGI penguin logo):&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Once the system is booted, you can log into terminals to interact with the BASH shell. Below is a root logon that shows the /proc/cpuinfo file that lists the R12000 CPU:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The system is quite fast - in the next little while, Peter and Aaron will be configuring the system more and installing software to see how fast the Octane performs.&#xA0; I installed Gentoo a year ago on an Octane and it was unbelievably fast (it smoked our classroom Pentium 4 (3GHz) systems with just Apache benchmarks.&#xA0; I think it will smoke our Core2Duos that we have now as well.&#xD;&#xD;For a detailed list of what Aaron and Peter did, download this file: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="Installing%20Linux%20on%20a%20Dead%20Badger%20using%20Reverse%20Osmosis,%20Octane%20MIPS%20R12000-1.doc"&gt;Installing Linux on a Dead Badger using Reverse Osmosis, Octane MIPS R12000.doc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&#xD;For anyone who is not familiar with Gentoo Linux, it is a Linux that strives to gain extra performance by compiling software according to a Portage Tree structure instead of pulling pre-compiled binaries off the Net.&#xA0; If you have seen the BBC television series &#x201C;The IT Crowd&#x201D; Season 2, you will notice a Gentoo box in the last episode as shown here:&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
