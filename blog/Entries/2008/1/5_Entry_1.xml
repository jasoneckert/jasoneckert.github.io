    <richText>&lt;b&gt;For the past several months, the Canadian dollar has been roughly equal to the value of the US dollar.&#xA0; Yet the Canadian prices on books are still incredibly inflated! &#xD;&#xD;Although the Canadian dollar in the past 15 years has consistently been worth about 85 cents to the US dollar, Canadians have always been screwed by an overinflated Canadian price on merchandise such as books.&#xA0; The book shown above costs $6.99US and $9.99CDN, which is almost a 50% markup!&#xA0;&#xA0; This markup is consistent across nearly all books at Canadian bookstores - here is another book ($13.95US or $19.99CDN):&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do publishers really need to rip off Canadians?&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 2005, I received a book called Learn the iPod for 5 Bucks by Stephen Gregory.&#xA0; During 2005, the Canadian dollar was only worth 85 cents to the US dollar, yet on the back of the book, the US and Canadian prices were the same (as shown below).&#xA0; This proves that it didn&#x2019;t really hurt the publisher to charge the same price for US and Canadian readers even though the Canadian dollar was only worth 85 cents US in 2005.&#xA0; So why should publishers care today when the Canadian dollar is worth the same as the US dollar? &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Anyways, the moral of this story is clear.&#xA0; It is cheaper to buy books from Amazon.com (US) and pay to ship it to Canada than it is to buy from Chapters.ca (Canadian).&#xA0; I have done this recently and will be doing it again soon.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
