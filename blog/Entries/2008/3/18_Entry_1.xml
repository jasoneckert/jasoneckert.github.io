    <richText>&lt;b&gt;The picture above is the new addition to our classroom - a binary clock! &#xD;&#xD;For years, you could get a small binary clock to sit on your desk, but nobody made a large binary clock that was suitable for hanging in a classroom.&#xA0; Now, they ARE available, and on sale at thinkgeek.com, so I couldn&#x2019;t resist :-)&#xD;&#xD;Below is a picture that describes how to read the time on it.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;I think binary stuff will really catch on.&#xA0; Soon we will see microwave ovens with binary touch pads as well as binary thermostats.&#xA0; That way, you could say things like &#x201C;Hey dear, could you turn the heat up a bit?&#x201D;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
