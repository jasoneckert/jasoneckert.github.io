    <richText>&lt;b&gt;In the past several months (and year), it seems that Linux is really making its way into the desktop market (up until now, it has ruled the server market).&#xA0; Every time I pick up a magazine at Chapters or read Google news, there is some new Linux device or technology.&#xA0; Here are a few that have caught my eye in the past short while:&#xD;&#xD;1. The rapid development of Compiz (formerly Beryl), which puts shame to all other desktop effects and is extremely easy to use and requires very few hardware resources to run.&#xD;&#xD;2. The rapid adoption of Ubuntu Linux on the desktop market as a Windows replacement (I use it every day on my laptop, and it is a great OS).&#xD;&#xD;3. Hardware manufacturers pre-installing Linux instead of Windows as an option on laptops and desktops (especially Dell and HP).&#xD;&#xD;4. The addition of Linux PCs and mobile devices - e.g.:&#xD;--Maemo Linux-powered Nokia N810 Internet Tablet&#xD;--Xandros Linux-powered ASUS Eee PC&#xD;--gOS Linux-based Everex gPC (a massive success and sell-out at Walmart)&#xD;&#xD;I bought a Nokia N810 Internet Tablet a few weeks ago (shown in the picture above) because I wanted something that would fit into your pocket and could be used to edit Google Docs, browse the Internet with Firefox, and do my attendance at the college (which is online). &#xD;&#xD;Honestly, I love the device - not because it has a dual-core ARM CPU, built-in GPS, amazing WiFi, full bluetooth support, USB 2.0, bright touchscreen, Webcam, sound processor, and hidden backlit keyboard - but because it runs Linux.&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Since it runs Linux, I can download tons of software for it or compile my own.&#xA0; As well, there is a huge Nokia Maemo Linux community for support (like any other Linux technology).&#xA0;&#xA0; Moreover, since I am an avid Linux user, I am used to the stability and security that comes with Open Source software, and wouldn&#x2019;t want to give that up.&#xA0; Oh, and yes, it is extremely sexy with its slim all-aluminum design (Nokia has a reputation for making products that are sleek and easy to use).&#xD;&#xD;Regardless, it looks like Linux is moving quickly into the desktop market (which I would have never dreamed of in a million years back in the 1990s).&#xA0; I look forward to watching it succeed in the years to come!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
