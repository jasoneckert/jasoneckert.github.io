    <richText>&lt;b&gt;We often take the speed of technological innovation for granted today - the picture above is of the following media types from the late 1970s to present. &#xD;&#xD;From left to right:&#xD;512KB 8-inch floppy (late 1970s to early 1980s)&#xD;1.2MB 5.25-inch floppy (early 1980s to early 1990s)&#xD;1.44MB 3.5-inch floppy (mid 1980s to mid 2000s)&#xD;1GB standard-size USB flash drive (early to mid 2000s)&#xD;4GB mini USB flash drive (mid 2000s to present)&#xD;8GB microSD flash card (present)&#xD;&#xD;I graphed the size against the median of the time period that it was used - you will notice that storage capacity of removable rewritable media has been rapidly climbing in the past decade.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD; Similarly, by graphing the size of each removable media (in inches) against the average time period it was used, you will also notice that media sizes are also reducing rapidly:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Now, the interesting part, after dividing the media size in KB by the physical size in inches to obtain the KB/inch, I graphed the KB/inch by the average year of usage and found the following:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;If you extrapolate the above graph, we should roughly have 30TB drives that fit on the end of a pencil by 2012.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Wicked.&#xA0; I shall start downloading more today to prepare...&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
