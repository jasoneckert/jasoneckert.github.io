    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Nearly everyone working in an Information Technology (IT) field has at least one IT-related certification. This is because IT certification is commonly used as a skills benchmark for hiring and promotion, and it&#x2019;s been that way for a long, long time.&#xD;&#xD;So where did all this certification stuff start?  If you look online, there isn&#x2019;t even a Wikipedia page that can give you that answer - like many things in the technology world that predated the Internet, it just wasn&#x2019;t important enough to keep track of in the Internet Age that started in the 1990s.&#xD;&#xD;The first technology company that offered a certification program for users of their products was &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Santa Cruz Operation (SCO)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, a UNIX OS vendor.  SCO started offering certification that tested proficiency in their UNIX product line in 1985.&#xD;&#xD;SCO offered three tiers of certification for each of the UNIX products they sold (Xenix, SCO UNIX, SCO OpenServer, and SCO UnixWare):&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	&#x2022;	CUSA (Certified Unix Systems Administrator)&#xD;	&#x2022;	ACE (Advanced Computing Expert)&#xD;	&#x2022;	Master ACE (Master Advanced Computing Expert)&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;These certifications were often very expensive, and required that you first sat a training course with a SCO instructor. If you you passed the certification exam, you received a printed certificate and a nice desk trophy made of lucite (CUSA/ACE) or crystal (Master ACE), as well as a lapel pin.  Here are my old SCO desk trophies:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Novell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; was the second vendor to offer certification.  They followed SCO&#x2019;s lead a year later in 1986, and also had three levels of certification for their NetWare line of products: &#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	&#x2022;	Certified Novell Administrator (CNA)&#xD;	&#x2022;	Certified Novell Expert (CNE) &#xD;	&#x2022;	Master  Certified Novell Expert (MCNE)  &#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;By the mid 1990s, many other vendors were also offering training and certification for their products.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;CompTIA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; started offering certification in computer hardware and software (CompTIA A+), and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microsoft&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; started offering both IT and developer certifications - the most popular of which were the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) and Microsoft Certified Systems Developer (MCSD).  &#xD;&#xD;While Novell, CompTIA and Microsoft didn&#x2019;t give out desk trophies when you passed their certification exams, you often got a Welcome kit that usually included a printed certificate, lapel pin and wallet card.  For a period of time in the late 1990s and early 2000s, if you went to an IT conference or event, you&#x2019;d see people with these lapel pins plastered on their jacket like an army general ;-)  I found a few of my old pins a few years back and stuck them on my office cork board:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;By the late 1990s, certification had become a staple in the IT job market, and there were &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sylvan Prometric&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pearson Virtual University Enterprises (VUE) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;centers around the world offering the exams electronically for a fee.  You could take an IT certification exam in most cities, not just large ones!&#xD;&#xD;Once this global testing infrastructure was in place, nearly all IT vendors (SUN, HP, RedHat, etc.) started offering certification exams.  By the year 2000, nearly every vendor had a certification exam for their products and technologies.  However, as IT certification became the norm, the extras that you got when you passed a certification slowly vanished. Today, you&#x2019;ll usually get a downloadable PDF certificate that you can print yourself, as well as a LinkedIn badge and a massive amount of email spam from the vendor.  And it all started with a company called SCO.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
