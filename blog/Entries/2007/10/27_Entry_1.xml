    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I installed Macintosh OS X 10.5 Leopard on all my Macs today.&#xA0; When you upgrade an OS, you always expect to lose some system settings and have some applications that don&#x2019;t like the new OS.&#xA0; As a result, I chose to install Leopard on my PowerBook G4 first.&#xA0; It has tons of software and I customized it to the max, so I naturally expected to spend a while tweaking it after the upgrade to get an idea of what I can expect when I upgrade my other computers.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The upgrade took about an hour, and when it was done, it was EXACTLY like it was before.&#xA0; I spent about 2 hours running every program, checking all my system settings, etc.&#xA0;&#xA0; Absolutely everything migrated perfectly.&#xA0;&#xA0; There was no learning curve either - the Dock and Finder look much better and have better features, but they are in the same spots you would normally expect them as an OS X user.&#xA0;&#xA0; The new features (Spaces, Time Machine, etc.) were easy to figure out in less than 10 seconds (Time Machine is very cool - the easiest backup system I have ever seen - I just need to wait for it to make more backups before I can play with it more).&#xD;&#xD;The only thing that freaked me out right after the upgrade was that the CPU ran at 100% most of the time, but the applications in Activity Monitor didn&#x2019;t add up to 100% (only about 30%), so there must have been some hidden process.&#xA0; Plus, the system still ran applications at regular (fast) speed while the CPU was running at 100% (which is not what normally happens when CPU usage is 100% - it should be dirt slow).&#xA0;&#xA0; I was thinking &#x201C;Oh shit, they made the OS power hungry like Vista.&#x201D;, but after 15 minutes, it went down to normal (about 5-15% CPU usage on my PowerBook). &#xD;&#xD;After that time, ALL of my programs opened and ran faster than before!&#xA0; I spent even more time playing with every application I had to verify this - it was a big difference from before - I am guessing 50-100% faster in almost all my applications - THANK YOU APPLE!&#xA0; I noticed that when I rebooted the laptop, that there was a message along the lines of &#x201C;Updating the Boot Cache&#x201D;, so Leopard probably has some cool caching structure that speeds things up.&#xA0; This explains the 100% CPU usage right after installation that didn&#x2019;t affect the system - Apple probably has a system process that doesn&#x2019;t show up anywhere (e.g. Activity Monitor) that indexes certain things passively in the background - this would use CPU time only if no other process was using it.&#xA0;&#xA0; I wonder how long it will take Microsoft to rip this feature off.....&#xD;&#xD;I upgraded the other Macs with the same result, except for my PowerMac G5.&#xA0; The upgrade said it was successful on the PowerMac G5, but when I booted I got a kernel panic and I couldn&#x2019;t boot from DVD or in Safe Mode until I reset the PRAM and SMU (pain in the ass!).&#xA0; I actually had to do another install, disable my Moodle database account, and change the ownership of my files to the right UID using chown.&#xA0; This is not something a novice user could do, and I am sure there are some pissed off people out there.&#xA0; Of course, that is entirely Apple&#x2019;s fault because it is a glitch that could have been prevented with proper testing. &#xD;&#xD;Overall, I can&#x2019;t really complain because Leopard exceeded my expectations.&#xA0; It has everything a good OS should have, more specifically:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	&#x2022;	It has application compatibility (I have yet to find an application that doesn&#x2019;t work)&#xD;	&#x2022;	It makes your system FASTER! (It is like the Anti-Vista!)&#xD;	&#x2022;	It migrates all of your settings beautifully&#xD;	&#x2022;	It has no learning curve, so you can continue to do your work immediately after the upgrade&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;Not a bad piece of software.&#xA0; I am appreciating it more and more as I continue to use it (even to do this blog).&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
