    <richText>&lt;b&gt;In much the same way that most actors never do their own stunts, most authors never draw their own diagrams or artwork.&#xA0; Instead, they create a somewhat detailed diagram and insert it alongside all other figures or screenshots with the instructions &#x201C;Create conceptual art&#x201D;, which tells the graphics team at the publisher to create a better looking diagram.&#xD;&#xD;I typically use quite a few diagrams in my textbooks to illustrate difficult or complex concepts.&#xA0; My diagrams are either done in Adobe Illustrator or Omnigraffle (a Visio-like product).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;In my Exchange Server 2007 textbook for Microsoft/Wiley, they liked my original diagrams so much that they didn&#x2019;t redo them (I must have done too good of a job in Omnigraffle).&#xA0;&#xA0; The picture at the top of this blog post is some rough work that I did that is similar to the types of figures in the book.&#xD;&#xD;Now comes the funny part.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The icons that I chose to use when creating my diagrams are actually from a Sun Microsystems template since I have a Sun SPARCstation 5 sitting next to my desk at work (Sun SPARC computers run UNIX instead of Windows!).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;For example, whenever I put a workstation in my diagrams, it was a Sun SPARCstation 5.&#xA0; Simply compare the picture above to the actual picture of the Sun SPARCstation 5 in my office shown to the right!&#xD;&#xD;Even the server icons represent Sun servers.&#xD;&#xD;Now consider that this is a Microsoft textbook that illustrates Exchange Server 2007 (which only runs on Windows servers and not Sun servers) with client computers running Microsoft Outlook (which only runs on Windows clients, not Sun workstations).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Can you see the subtle humor?&#xA0; All the diagrams in the book represent computers that can&#x2019;t possibly be running the software that the diagram is supposed to represent!&#xA0; When I created the diagrams, I never thought that they would actually wind up in the book since most publishers redo all the artwork using their own templates.....but that is how it ended up in this book.&#xA0; And I think the subtle humor makes the book even more awesome!&#xD;&#xD;I should also note that this was one of my favorite books that I&#x2019;ve written! I am quite pleased with how it turned out, and I added a great deal of supporting material to it that really makes it a comprehensive book on everything to do with email and Exchange Server.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
