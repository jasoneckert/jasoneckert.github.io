    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Yesterday, someone reminded me of those old Unisys ICON computers (also called the Burroughs ICON) that were used in Ontario schools back in the 1980s and early 1990s.&#xA0; I used them extensively when I attended Galt Collegiate Institute (one of the oldest high schools in Canada - see picture above).&#xD;&#xD;To prevent ICONs from being lost in history, I thought I would add a blog entry about them today.&#xA0; The ICON was an overpriced, underpowered custom computer built for the Ontario Ministry of Education for use in their school system (see picture to the left).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;At $2500, they had a Commodore PET look to them, 512KB of RAM and an Intel 80186 CPU (which was just a glorified 8086, and much slower than the 80286 CPUs of the time).&#xA0; Instead of a mouse, they had this weird trackball that was recessed into the case and difficult to move around - plus, it often gave you a static shock when you first touched it.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;They were networked together using ARCnet to a classroom fileserver (called LEXICON) which was basically the same hardware (80186 CPU), but with an extra 1MB of RAM, an 8&#x201D; floppy disk for loading programs, and a 70MB hard drive (64MB formatted).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;All the ICON computers were diskless clients. They netbooted their OS from this classroom fileserver.&#xA0; One or two of them had a built-in floppy drive, but were only for teacher use.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The best feature of the computer was its OS - it ran QNX (a UNIX operating system that still exists today and runs stuff such as traffic lights and high-end Cisco backbone routers).&#xA0; I must say that the ICON GUI was somewhat slick for the time, but we mainly used the command line to learn stuff like PASCAL, Turing and C programming (the WATCOM compiler tools of course :-).&#xA0;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
