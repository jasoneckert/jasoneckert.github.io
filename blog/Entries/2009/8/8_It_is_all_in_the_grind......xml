    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I am a coffee addict - this compliments my purpose in life, which is to transport large quantities of caffeine from the coffee maker to the urinal.&#xD;&#xD;In addition, I am extremely keen on getting the &#x201C;best&#x201D; cup of coffee.&#xA0; If I need to get coffee on the road, I&#x2019;ll choose a Bold roast from Starbucks such as Gold Coast, Gazebo, or Sumatra, or a Cafe Americano (expresso).&#xA0; Tim Hortons and McDonalds are too mellow for me, but I&#x2019;ll drink it when I&#x2019;m not in Starbucks country.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;At home, coffee making is a bit tougher.&#xA0; For years, I thought the best coffee was made by the Starbucks Utopia vacuum coffee maker, which made excellent coffee (it didn&#x2019;t burn off the oils in the coffee like regular coffee makers, thus preserving the entire flavor in the beans).&#xA0;&#xA0; However, when my Starbucks Utopia broke, I learned that they didn&#x2019;t make it anymore and a friend told me to try a steel Bodum, which French-presses coffee in much the same way that the Utopia did.&#xA0; Low and behold, it was even better than the Utopia!&#xD;&#xD;I would buy Starbucks coffee beans (Bold of course), grind them in my electric burr grinder (which gives a better grind than regular coffee grinders), dump the grinds into the steel Bodum, pour in water (just off boil), wait 4 minutes, press the steel filter down and pour the coffee.&#xD;&#xD;However, this past week, I have learned how to make EVEN BETTER coffee! While I was in Algonquin Provincial Park (think middle of nature, no electricity, no humans, etc.) I had to grind my own beans without the electric burr grinder.&#xA0; So, at the Lake Opeongo Outfitting store (where they sell gear for long and rugged canoe/camping trips), I bought a manual burr coffee grinder (see the picture above).&#xA0; It is the Lexan JavaGrind, which is made of nearly indestructible resin, detaches and folds so it uses far less space in your backpack, and most importantly, has a beautiful ceramic burr grinding base (the brown part in the picture).&#xD;&#xD;What I learned while getting in touch with nature is that the grinder makes a huge difference in the cup of coffee - it took me several tries to get it right, but I found that with a manual burr grinder, you can slow the grinding process down and speed it up in waves to get a more or less asymmetrical or &#x201C;jagged&#x201D; cut - this results in a mixture of rough, fine and very fine coffee grinds in the same batch of coffee grinds.&#xA0; By using this method to grind 15-20% more Starbucks Bold roast coffee beans than you would normally use to make coffee, and then brewing them using a steel Bodum, you will get a most amazing flavorful cup of coffee!&#xD;&#xD;You must try it. &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Buy the following:&#xD;&#x2022;Lexan JavaGrind Portable Coffee Grinder with ceramic burr by GSI (about $30)&#x2028;&#x2022;Columbia Thermal Coffee Press By Bodum/Starbucks (about $60)&#x2028;&#x2022;Bold Starbucks coffee (Sumatra, Gold Coast, Sidamo, Gazebo, etc. - about $14/pound)&#x2028;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measure the amount of coffee beans recommended for the number of cups you are going to brew, and then add 15-20% more beans.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 3: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Place the beans in the Lexan JavaGrind and close the slider.&#xA0; Take the cover off the ceramic burr, and place the Lexan JavaGrind over your Columbia Thermal Coffee Press (or similar steel Bodum).&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 4:&#xA0;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; Start very slowly grinding the beans (you will hear them crack apart).&#xA0; After a few seconds, speed up the grind until you can&#x2019;t hear the cracking (because it is too fast) and then slow back down again.&#xA0; Repeat this process until the coffee is completely ground.&#xA0; You can even do it to music, while chanting, or while performing a rain dance around a camp fire (kind of like summoning the coffee gods with an ancient indian ritual).&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 5:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xA0; Remove the Lexan JavaGrind and look at the beans - they should look rough and not have a definite consistency.&#xA0; Boil enough water for the number of cups of coffee you with to make.&#xA0; Just before you get a rolling boil, pour the water into the Columbia Thermal Coffee Press and put the top on (do NOT press the plunger/filter yet!).&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 6:&#xA0;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; After waiting approximately 4 minutes, press the plunger/filter on the Columbia Thermal Coffee Press and pour the coffee.&#xA0; Enjoy!&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;I drink coffee black without milk/cream/sweetener.&#xA0; If you are the type of person who likes milk/cream/sweetener in their coffee, try it first without and you will probably be hooked.&#xA0; A good coffee is best drunk black.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
