    <richText>&lt;b&gt;The first &#x201C;real&#x201D; GUI computer on the market turns 25 today.&#xA0; But its more than just that.&#xA0; The original Macintosh in 1984 was developed as the &#x201C;computer that will change the world&#x201D;.&#xA0; With its graphical user interface and mouse, it brought us into modern computing.&#xD;&#xD;I collect Macintoshes and have every model from the 1980s and early 1990s including the original Macintosh 128K from 1984 (shown above).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;I powered it up this morning and it ran as well as it did when it was new 25 years earlier.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The picture to the right is my daughter posing next to the same original Macintosh computer that I powered up this morning.&#xA0; Her name, ironically, is Mackenzie, but she prefers to be called &#x201C;Mac&#x201D;.&#xD;&#xD;Moreover, I keep a spare Mac at my college to show students that graphical interface design hasn&#x2019;t really come a long way in 25 years - the original Mac OS has the same basic components, look, and feel of all modern OSes today!&#xD;&#xD;I tried to find a YouTube video to post in my blog entry that clearly indicates the &#x201C;experience&#x201D; of using an original Mac, but they all had bad quality - however, the BBC released a great video yesterday in their &#x201C;Apple's first Macintosh turns 25&#x201D; story that does a great job since it actually demos a real Macintosh computer running the early Mac OS.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Although the author of the story doesn&#x2019;t actually point out the merits of the early Mac OS directly, she does so indirectly by opening files on the Desktop and using the menus to copy and paste in exactly the same fluid way that we do today.&#xA0; It is close to what I like to show people using my original Mac demos.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Here is the link to the story and video: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7846575.stm"&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7846575.stm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &#xD;&#xD;Oh, and I almost forgot......Happy 25th Macintosh - you are still leading the rest of the computing world into the future!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
