    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Today is the 40th anniversary of the opening of the Ontario Science Centre in 1969.&#xA0; Since we are members of the Ontario Science Centre, we got there an hour-and-a-half early because we knew the crowds would be horrendous and wanted to get a good parking spot (ironically, we got the first parking spot).&#xD;&#xD;They had a ton of cool events all day including:&#xD;&#xD;Pop, pizza, hotdogs, coffee, etc. for 69&#xA2; (I overindulged).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;A treasure hunt game where you had to find 40 letters that matched the 40 numbers on your guidebook by looking for the different signs posted around the Ontario Science Centre. If you got all 40 letters and filled in the right words, you could fill out the back and drop it in a box for a chance to win a bunch of prizes including a Telus BlackBerry Storm (my preferred prize).&#xA0; Ironically, after looking at the pictures we took, we noticed the one shown above, which actually had the answers in it: ENGAGE EXPLORE EXPERIENCE INTERACT INNOVATE!&#xD;&#xD;Free viewings of the first Canadian IMAX film (North of Superior, 1971), which was pretty impressive.&#xA0; They had huge panoramas of flying through the amazing shorlines and mountains in Northern Ontario as well as logging, forest fires, reforestation, mining, and social life (including Native Canadian social life).&#xA0; It was one of the best IMAX films I have ever seen (and its from 1971 - it surprised us for sure).&#xD;&#xD;Bubble foam &#x201C;floatees&#x201D; which were made at the front of the building and floated all over the place in the wind - they were in the shape of the trillium (the symbol of Ontario and the Ontario Science Centre).&#xA0; Below is a picture of one that floated over some trees.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Telus Text Challenge where you could test your typing skills on a mobile smartphone to win one of several prizes (I won a Telus Meerkat stuffed animal).&#xD;&#xD;There are also plenty of other cool attractions at the Ontario Science Centre (too many to list here - it would take several days to see everything available since the Ontario Science Centre is phenomenally huge!).&#xA0; One of the neatest outdoor attractions is the water organ - there are two organs opposite each other, and you stand behind the curved bar (see below) and place your fingers over holes that water is seeping out of to create a disturbance in the bottom of a large angled cylinder that causes it to make loud sounds.&#xA0; I played the Moonlight Sonata, Fugue in D Minor, and The Entertainer while I was there.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The inside of the Ontario Science Centre is where all the really cool stuff is though, such as the rainforest, science arcade, bat cave, planetarium, etc.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;And next is a picture of my daughter playing a synthesizer that causes a ferrous liquid within a circular chamber to resonate and produce cool effects based on the pitch of the notes that are played.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Most of the exhibits in the Ontario Science Centre are, and have always been interactive (which is good).&#xA0; As a result, many of them have computers that ask you to input or select different things to learn something about science.&#xA0; Up until a few years ago, you would still see old Mac Classics in some of the exhibits (because the exhibits are very well made), but those have largely been replaced by new touchscreen LCDs running &#x201C;who-know-what-OS&#x201D;.&#xD;&#xD;However, in the human body section, I did notice a few computers that ran what looked like programs written in TCL on the CDE UNIX desktop, and some that were definitely old Mac programs.&#xA0; One of the exhibits, which had a new beautiful 21&#x201D; Neovo LCD display hadn&#x2019;t been started by the time we got to it (we were one of the first people in the doors) - it was still sitting at the OS screen waiting for a staff member to start the exhibit program.&#xA0; And guess what OS it was running.........Macintosh System 7.5.2 from 1992 (see the somewhat crude picture below that I took of the LCD).&#xA0; So, within the exhibit enclosure was some old PowerMac that was still running fine after 15 years or so - which makes perfect sense, because when I started the exhibit, it looked just as good as a program that was made on a computer this year since it showed how disease spread around the world when you chose different conditions.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Overall, the Ontario Science Centre is an amazing place to go, and one of the best science centres in the world (I have been to many other science centres that are far far smaller and less interesting).&#xA0; As a result, my daughter and I have been members at the Ontario Science Centre for 9 years now, and we would wholeheartedly recommend it as a great place to visit for anyone of any age.&#xD;&#xD;NOTE: You will notice that the pictures above give the impression that the place is not crowded - that is because my daughter and I got there early (before others arrived), and also got in early (as members) and knew exactly where we wanted to go first.&#xA0; By the time we went from level 6 back up to level 1 (the whole building is built on the slope of a valley), it looked like a Mumbai marketplace (wall-to-wall people everywhere and huge lineups for everything).&#xA0; If you go, get there early :-)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
