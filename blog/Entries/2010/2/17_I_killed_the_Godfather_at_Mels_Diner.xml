    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Yes, today I did a very stupid thing.&#xA0; I ate a Godfather burger @ Mel&#x2019;s Diner in Waterloo.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s a 3-pound hamburger: two layers of 9 thick hamburger patties with cheese and bacon on an oversized bun (basically a round loaf of bread).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;If you eat the thing within an hour-and-a-half, plus the fries and coleslaw, you get a shirt that says I killed the Godfather at Mel&#x2019;s Diner Waterloo.&#xA0; As of today, 326 people failed to finish it, and 52 people finished it. I turned that number from 52 to 53 today, which also happens to be the port for DNS (my favorite network service).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;I will say this:&#xA0; I AM NEVER DOING THIS AGAIN! &#xD;&#xD;In fact, I don&#x2019;t think I can stare at a hamburger again for a very long time.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The picture to the right depicts my general feeling after eating the burger.&#xD;&#xD;The first half was easy (about 10 minutes).&#xA0; The next quarter took about 20 minutes, and the last quarter took almost an hour (I had to listen to heavy metal music on my daughters iPod to get the stamina to finish the last bit).&#xA0;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
