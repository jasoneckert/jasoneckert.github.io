    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I have always wanted to do a blog post listing my favorite personal computers (PCs) of all time.&#xA0; Lots of other people do it, but I want my list to be different.&#xA0; And who lists the top PCs of all time on Christmas?&#xA0; No one - because they do something mushy or holiday-related instead.&#xA0; So I will.&#xA0; Here is my personal list (in order) of what I think are the top 15 PCs of all time and why.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;15. Apple IIc&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back in the 1970s, the Apple II line of computers quickly became one of the most powerful home/business/school PCs, with thousands of software programs written for it.&#xA0; Apple II computers were still used by most schools in the early-mid 1990s!  In 1984, Apple introduced my favorite computer in the Apple II product line: the Apple IIc (compact).&#xA0; It had an 8-bit MOS 65C02 CPU and 128KB of RAM (which was pretty decent for the time), as well as a nice slim form factor and integrated 5.25&#x201D; floppy disk drive, which made it a truly portable Apple II computer if you were willing to also carry around a monitor.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. Commodore PET 4032&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;This computer revolutionized the PC industry in the late 1970s.&#xA0; Commodore bought the chip manufacturer MOS and built its PET computer around the MOS 6502 CPU.&#xA0; It was really the first affordable all-in-one computer, and as a result, made it way into schools quickly, where people learned to program in BASIC on it.&#xA0;&#xA0; The PET 4032 was one of the last models of PET made - it had 32KB of RAM, a larger screen and better keyboard, as well as disk storage (earlier PETs used a datasette tape drive, which was unreliable).&#xA0; If you remove two screws on either side of the case, the entire top of the case/monitor flipped up to reveal the motherboard and power supply - it even had a little rod that kept it propped up like a car hood while you were working on it. &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. IBM PC 5150&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most people usually give this computer a much higher rank because it is essentially &#x201C;the first PC of all time&#x201D; (in the 1980s and 1990s, the term &#x201C;PC&#x201D; referred to any computer that was an IBM or IBM clone that used the Intel CPU architecture).&#xA0;&#xA0; However, I&#x2019;m going to rank it 13th here.&#xA0; This PC is absolutely beautiful inside and well made (mine still works today).&#xA0; However, for a price tag of $4,000(US) in 1981, you got an Intel 8088 CPU, 64KB of RAM, and two disk drives like the one shown in the picture to the right.&#xA0; It was a beautiful PC, but priced out of range for the average household - most people in the early 1980s wouldn&#x2019;t recognize this computer as a home PC.&#xA0; However, they sold extremely well in the business market.&#xA0; They weren&#x2019;t particularly a good value for a business computer at the time (there were far more cheaper alternatives that did the same job), but because IBM made it, companies bought them up like hot cakes - there is an old saying that goes along the lines of &#x201C;you&#x2019;ll never get fired for buying IBM.&#x201D;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Osborne 1&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Osborne 1 is truly the first portable computer!&#xA0; Although it only had a 5&#x201D; monitor, it boasted a Zilog Z80 CPU (very fast for the time), 64KB of RAM, two floppy drives, and modem - all for well under $2,000(US)!&#xA0; And it looked super cool - it looked liked a serious, bad-ass computer - one that could activate a nuclear missile (like in the 1985 movie &#x201C;Spies Like Us&#x201D;).&#xA0; It was made very very well, and had a somewhat aerodynamic feel to it when you carried it around (hard to describe).&#xA0; And since it ran the CP/M OS, there was tons of software available for it. However, Osborne died out quickly because the company announced an upgraded version too early (which starved them of Osborne 1 sales to the point that the company never recovered).&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Apple Macintosh SE/30&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;When the original Apple Macintosh was released in 1984, it was a revolution - the first computer that had true graphical interface and mouse!&#xA0; But graphics require power, and although the first Macintosh had a powerful Motorola 68000 CPU, it only had 128KB of RAM and a floppy disk to store the OS and programs (both of which were a big limitation for graphical software).&#xA0; The Macintosh SE/30 fixed all of this to an extreme level - it was the fastest &#x201C;classic&#x201D; Macintosh of the 1980s.&#xA0; Under the hood was a very powerful Motorola 68030 CPU, up to 128MB of RAM (128MB in 1989!), and an internal 80MB hard disk.&#xA0; In fact, this Mac was so powerful, it could also run A/UX, which was Apple&#x2019;s version of UNIX (which could also run Macintosh applications).&#xA0; You could also get a Thinnet Ethernet expansion card that fit into the back of the computer - as a result, the SE/30 was often used as a file server on TCP/IP networks, or as a terminal that connected to back-end UNIX servers (we used them at the University of Waterloo to connect to our big Sun UNIX servers).&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Commodore 64&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is the best-selling computer of all time ever!&#xA0; The Commodore PET and Commodore VIC 20 solidified Commodore in the PC market, but were largely underpowered for software of the early 1980s.&#xA0; When the Commodore 64 was released in 1982 with 64KB of RAM and a MOS 6510 8-bit CPU, it rivaled the competition at the time because it was cheaper and technologically superior - for example, when you played a graphical game on the Commodore 64, it always looked and sounded better than the same game for the Apple II.&#xA0; But the best part of this computer was the software - if there was a program that you wanted, it would always be available for the Commodore 64!&#xA0;&#xA0; As a result, if you had a home computer in the 1980s, it was probably a Commodore 64, and you were affectionately known as a Commodork.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Intel 80386&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;By the mid 1980s, the Intel architecture used in the original IBM PC was copied by dozens of different computer manufacturers, creating &#x201C;IBM PC clones&#x201D; - this solidified Intel&#x2019;s dominance in the computer market and Intel poured the money back into R&amp;D.&#xA0; In 1985, Intel released the 80386 32-bit CPU, and it became the standard for PCs for many years.&#xA0; More importantly, 80386 PCs became widespread in homes, schools, and business.&#xA0; The widespread availability of IBM PC clones attracted hundreds of thousands of people to the computing world - in fact, the first PC that I bought with my own money was a PC clone with an 80386 and 4MB of RAM running DOS/Windows 3.1.&#xA0;&#xA0; You could get them in either a desktop (horizontal) or tower (vertical) model.&#xA0; They almost always had both a 5.25&#x201D; and 3.5&#x201D; floppy drive as well as a small hard drive and if you were lucky, a CD-ROM drive - when you pressed the button on early CD-ROM drives, the whole drive popped out so that you could insert the CD-ROM disc (no slim removable trays like we have today).&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Sun Ultra 2&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not all PCs are used for home computing.&#xA0; Many professional PCs, such as the Sun Ultra 2 with dual 64-bit UltraSPARC RISC CPUs, dual SCSI hard drives, and 2GB of RAM, were a bit pricey in 1997 (about $50,000), but had the power to run extremely complex graphical and scientific/engineering software that a home PC of the time couldn&#x2019;t dream of running.&#xA0; Sun Microsystems has always made good, solid computers that were lighting fast, and I think that the Ultra 2 was their best desktop PC.&#xA0; I used one of these to run my regression analyses for a few years, and it just took everything that I could throw at it with ease.&#xA0; If it could talk, it would probably say &#x201C;Is that all you got? Give me a break.&#x201D;&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. IBM/Lenovo Thinkpad&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;I&#x2019;ve always thought that IBM made good, solid computers.&#xA0; And the IBM Thinkpad (1992-2005) and Lenovo Thinkpad (2005-present) are great examples of this - when you pick it up, you can feel that you are picking up a solid device.&#xA0; They are powerful, well-built laptops that can take any punishment that you can dish out - in fact, they are the only laptop certified for use on the International Space Station!&#xA0; Plus, they have top-notch components that are easy to upgrade, and you can always find drivers for them for any OS from the IBM/Lenovo website.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Apple Macintosh PowerBook 540c&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Apple really pioneered the laptop era in the early 1990s - they were the first to introduce innovations that other laptop manufacturers adopted in their products.&#xA0; Their laptops were also smaller than other laptops of the time, and better designed. The PowerBook line of laptops was extensively used for personal and corporate computing from 1992 to 2006 - they were as rugged as a Thinkpad, but easy to use.&#xA0; The PowerBook 540c introduced in 1994 was one of the best laptops of all time - in addition to having a fast Motorola 68040 CPU (upgradable to PowerPC), 36MB of RAM, SCSI hard drive and active matrix color LCD display, it introduced the trackpad that was eventually adopted in all laptops to navigate the OS.&#xA0; Plus, if the 540c is good enough to be used extensively in the movie &#x201C;Hackers&#x201D; (1995), then it must be a good computer ;-)&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Intel Pentium&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the early-mid 1990s, when the PC revolution blossomed and the Internet spread faster than kudzu, Intel delivered a revolutionary new CPU called Pentium that quickly became the standard for IBM-based PCs (recall that they were often called IBM clones), and eventually led to the Pentium II, III, and IV (as well as the AMD variants).&#xA0; The Pentium introduced some nice RISC components, and performed extremely well (it blew away the 80486!).&#xA0; Moreover, with the Introduction of Windows 95 at roughly the same time, the Pentium PC took computing to a whole new level within a very short period of time and essentially killed Macintosh (until Steve Jobs returned in 1997).&#xA0; With Windows 95 and the Netscape Navigator web browser, the Intel Pentium was the computer that really ushered in the Internet era and brought so many people online that never used computers before - many people I know remember their first computer as a Pentium I.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Apple MacBook Pro&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are only two other computers that can take the same punishment that an IBM Thinkpad can take: the Apple PowerBook, and the Apple MacBook Pro.&#xA0; In 2006, the aluminum PowerPC PowerBook line at Apple was replaced with the Intel MacBook Pro.&#xA0; The MacBook Pro is a very powerful laptop that uses top-of-the-line components and a lightning fast bus designed specifically by Intel for Apple&#xA0; - it is so fast, that Microsoft demoed Windows Vista on MacBook Pros during their North American and Europe tours because it was the fastest laptop that could run Windows.&#xA0; Plus, the unibody construction and high-quality components make this laptop the BMW of computers today.&#xA0;&#xA0; If you want a powerful laptop today that is well made, aesthetic, and easy to use, this is the one to get.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. DEC Ultimate Workstation(a.k.a. AlphaServer 1200)&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the 1990s, the most powerful computer platform in the world was the DEC Alpha - their 64-bit RISC CPU architecture ran faster than any other CPU of the time - when other vendors were pumping out 200MHz CPUs, DEC was pumping out 500MHz CPUs.&#xA0; In fact, some people had stickers for their computer that said &#x201C;My other computer is a DEC Alpha.&#x201D;&#xA0; And, if you had the money, say $80,000(US) in 1997, then you could get a DEC Ultimate Workstation (a.k.a. AlphaServer 1200) with 4GB of RAM, 9 SCSI hard disks, and two 533MHz&#xA0; 64-bit Alpha RISC CPUs.&#xA0; The DEC Alpha is to other PCs of the time like an M1 Army Tank is to a Toyota Prius.&#xA0; They were built like a tank inside, and used a ton of power (two 1000W power supplies to power the whole thing).&#xA0; It was a serious workstation that could run VMS, UNIX, Linux or Windows (NT/2000).&#xA0; I still use one of these to demo RAID in my classroom.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Apple iMac (all generations)&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Few computers have managed to change the world of personal computing like the iMac.&#xA0; When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he turned the company around by innovating again.&#xA0; The iMac was the main result of this innovation.&#xA0; It is what a PC should be.....an all-in-one computer that is easy to use.&#xA0; After all, the purpose of computing is to make our lives and jobs easier.&#xA0; From the original iMac to the latest generation iMac, Apple has shown us that a PC can be something that you want to use.&#xA0; I use an iMac as my main desktop computer (I&#x2019;m doing this blog post on it right now), and it doesn't feel like I&#x2019;m using a computer at all - the Mac OS X operating system stays out of my way and lets me do what I want to do, and the hardware looks and feels sexy.&#xA0; I&#x2019;d rather do a term paper on a Mac than watch a porno on a PC.&#xA0; Who doesn&#x2019;t want the latest large-screen iMac running OS X?&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. SGI Octane&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are many reasons why I chose the 1997 Silicon Graphics (SGI) Octane as the best PC of all time.&#xA0; Firstly, it is amazingly fast.&#xA0; So fast, in fact, that it is hard to describe........using an Octane is like riding in a sonic jet plane for computer geeks.&#xA0; They usually had two 64-bit MIPS R10000 RISC CPUs, 2GB of RAM, 3 SCSI hard drives, and a massively-powerful video card (the video card was half of the computer!).&#xA0; But what made this computer better than a DEC Alpha was the OS that it ran: IRIX (SGI UNIX).&#xA0; IRIX was a &#x201C;fun&#x201D; graphical UNIX that was also very powerful - most Octanes were used for heavy-duty scientific visualization programs, or animation programs such as Maya and Blender.&#xA0; They were also built like a tank (a small tank in the form of a cube that could easily fit on your desk next to the monitor) and weighted a ton!&#xA0; Each component/board slides out on rails using a latch mechanism, and the unit glows blue when powered on.&#xA0; In short, this computer was beautiful, fast, extremely powerful, and ran an amazing OS.&#xA0; It was the dream machine for so many computer geeks back in the 1990s.&#xA0; And today, it still runs Linux faster than my Intel Core2Duo PC!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
