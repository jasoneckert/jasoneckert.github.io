    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Today, we took my nephew to the Ontario Science Centre for his birthday.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;While we were there, we noticed something weird - the place was packed with a ton of women in rock climbing gear and equipment..........well at least that is what it looked like at first.........but upon closer inspection, they were just &#x201C;professional mommies&#x201D; (a George Carlin term) that were carrying every yuppie gadget available on the open market, with oversized strollers and carryon bags full of gear and food that could help an African village survive a 4-month drought.&#xD;&#xD;Anywhere we went, these professional mommies would usually be standing around in full gear talking to other professional mommies while holding a Starbucks coffee.&#xA0; Meanwhile, their slightly older kids (between the ages of 2 and 5) would be running around the entire place knocking things over, screaming, and reenacting &#x201C;The Lord of the Flies.&#x201D;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;This is what gets me:&#xA0; They almost always congregated at the cafeteria or in wide open areas in large numbers - I never saw any of them actually look at the exhibits.&#xA0; In almost all cases, their kids were far too young to get anything out of the exhibits anyways. &#xD;&#xD;Perhaps it is just fashionable or trendy to show up in places like the Ontario Science Centre with kids and kid gear to validate their professional mommy-ism.&#xA0; I just don&#x2019;t get it.&#xA0; It seems like such a waste of time.&#xA0; There really should be &#x201C;kid parks&#x201D; for these people around the city where kids can run around like wild animals while their professional mommies ignore them while they talk amongst themselves - sort of like a dog park, but without dogs.&#xA0; Or better yet, they could put them in an area of the Ontario Science Centre surrounded by windows where people could observe them - they could make a whole exhibit of it called &#x201C;Behavioral patterns in lower primates.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0; Just throwing this idea out there.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The moral of this post is simple, and I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve guessed it by now - professional mommies who let their kids run wild in the Ontario Science Centre piss everyone else off.&#xA0; If you can get to an area without screaming kids, then it is quite enjoyable.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
