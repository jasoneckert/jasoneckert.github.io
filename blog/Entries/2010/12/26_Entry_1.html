                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="Body">To complement my last post, I decided to do a blog post listing what I think are the top 12 server platforms (actually, that is a lie, I’m just doing it because Jeff Smith emailed me wanting to know where the beloved AS/400 is).  I didn’t decide to rank the results, because some descriptions need to lead into others, but my favorite server platform of all time below is the UltraSPARC platform (read on to find out why).<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">IBM System/370 Mainframe<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">From the 1960s to today, IBM pretty much ruled most of the mainframe market, with DEC, Data General, and Honeywell as minor players.  A mainframe is simply a very very large amount of metal that companies used to ensure that they didn’t pay too much tax during a profitable year - they weren’t designed for speed or efficiency - they were designed to print balance sheets and income statements (COBOL and RPG were programming languages used on these mainframes specifically for this).<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">In the 1960s, the IBM System/360 (running OS/360) was common - it was later replaced with the much improved and backwards-compatible IBM System/370 (running OS/370) throughout the 1970s and 1980s - the most popular and common mainframe ever produced.  System/370s pretty much ruled the biggest companies in the world at that time, but took up a whole room.<br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 270px; width: 401px;  height: 270px; position: relative; width: 401px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_2 inline-block stroke_0 shadow_0"><img src="26_Entry_1_files/droppedImage.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 270px; width: 401px; " /></div><br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">In the 1990s, IBM sold the IBM System/390 (running OS/390), but by that time, many large companies were moving away from mainframes to distributed server-based networks since they cost a lot less - they would usually keep their old mainframes around for some use mainly because IBM loves to make it hard to migrate from their products, and newer mainframes are always backwards-compatible to older ones.  For the same reason, some companies still buy mainframes today - since 2000, IBM has been selling their IBM z-Series 64-bit mainframes, but most people run Linux on them rather than the z/OS that was designed for it.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">IBM System/38 <br /></p>
                <p class="Body">IBM knew darn well that it couldn’t sell mainframes to every company - only large, rich bureaucracies could afford mainframes (which worked at bureaucratic speeds much to their delight).  So IBM produced a series of high-performance mid-range servers for companies in the 1970s that used a 48-bit address space (very large for the time), starting with the IBM System/38.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 99px; width: 173px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 99px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 12px; position: relative; width: 173px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_3 inline-block stroke_0 shadow_1"><img src="26_Entry_1_files/droppedImage_1.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 99px; width: 173px; " /></div>The System/38 was a beast, but it was a great performing beast compared to mainframes (performance/cost) and had a ton of great peripherals such as large capacity hard drives - the IBM 3380 hard drive shown to the right was pulled from a working System/38 - it could store 2.5GB in 1980 for $140,000(US) and may fit into the trunk of your car (if you have a big trunk).<br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">IBM AS/400 <br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 201px; width: 151px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 201px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 12px; position: relative; width: 151px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_3 inline-block stroke_0 shadow_2"><img src="26_Entry_1_files/droppedImage_2.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 201px; width: 151px; " /></div>In 1988, the System/38 evolved into the backwards-compatible AS/400 (running OS/400), which was probably the most reliable server ever made!  Downtime was impossible to this machine - and it performed hundreds of times better than the System/38.   Nearly all companies that needed a moderate level of computing in the late 1980s to mid 1990s used one of these servers.<br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Even Microsoft used AS/400s widely in the early 1990s - Bill Gates once said that the only part of IBM that he would consider buying was the AS/400 division.  I had a AS/400 B server in my basement for a while (shown to the right) - after 20 years, though, it wouldn’t IPL (boot), so I took it apart (outside) to bask in its awesome design.  It was one hell of a well made machine. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">IBM POWER <br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 185px; width: 185px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 185px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 12px; position: relative; width: 185px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_3 inline-block stroke_0 shadow_3"><img src="26_Entry_1_files/droppedImage_3.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 185px; width: 185px; " /></div>After the AS/400 was released, IBM decided that they didn’t want to put all of their eggs in one basket, so they released the RS/6000 series of servers that primarily ran UNIX (IBM AIX) using the new PowerPC/POWER RISC architecture.  The picture to the right is an F50 RS/6000 with dual PowerPC 604 CPUs.<br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">The PowerPC/POWER architecture was extremely powerful and an amazing performer (it runs most of the largest supercomputers in the world today), but power hungry.  The RS/6000 line proved to be almost as reliable as the AS/400 line, and was outselling the AS/400 by leaps and bounds by the late 1990s.  So, IBM merged the two lines and focused on the POWER architecture - the IBM System i platform was geared to original AS/400 and mainframe customers, whereas the IBM System p platform was geared to original RS/6000 customers.  Today, most people just run Linux on their System i or System p servers anyways ;-)<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">DEC PDP-11<br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 241px; width: 155px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 241px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 12px; position: relative; width: 155px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_3 inline-block stroke_0 shadow_4"><img src="26_Entry_1_files/droppedImage_4.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 241px; width: 155px; " /></div>Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) entered the computing market as the “affordable alternative” - you could buy a DEC computer that performed the same as a computer that cost 10 times as much!  Similarly, most universities bought DEC computers from the 1960s onwards.   What this did was build the amount of talent and software surrounding the platform very quickly.  The PDP-11 of the 1970s was one of the first 16-bit computers that was designed to be affordable for most companies, and the first one designed for mass production.  It was about as powerful as other 16-bit minicomputers at the time such as the Data General Eclipse, but it sold well because of its lower price and larger community of software developers.  It was also long lived - a PDP-11 ran the info banner on the information channel for the Roger’s television network here in Ontario until the early 2000s!  Because of its large install base and academic involvement, the PDP-11 also influenced the design of several other computers and architectures, including the Motorola 68000.<br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">DEC VAX<br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 148px; width: 146px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 148px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 12px; position: relative; width: 146px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_3 inline-block stroke_0 shadow_5"><img src="26_Entry_1_files/droppedImage_5.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 148px; width: 146px; " /></div>The VAX (Virtual Address eXpansion) was a 32-bit extension of the PDP-11 that had several important enhancements such as virtual memory.  The VAX 11/780 shown to the right was one of their most commonly sold models. <br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Although DEC made an OS specifically for it called VMS, most people just installed UNIX on it instead - and it was an extremely powerful 32-bit platform for the time that cost much less than a System/38, but could outperform it easily!  DEC also introduced excellent networking support (including Ethernet) and were the first to use their VAXen in network-based clusters. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">DEC Alpha<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">When DEC realized it needed to rejuvenate its VAX line in the mid 1980s, it went all-out in its design - they wanted a platform that would last a long time, be extremely powerful, and be backwards compatible to VAX.  The result, after more than a billion dollars in research and development, was the 64-bit RISC DEC Alpha CPU platform.  And, for the 1990s, the DEC Alpha was the most powerful CPU on the planet by a large margin!  They put the word “super” into “supercomputers.”   But you had to pay a large premium to get it - they were very very expensive.<br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 405px; width: 401px;  height: 405px; position: relative; width: 401px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_2 inline-block stroke_0 shadow_6"><img src="26_Entry_1_files/droppedImage_6.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 405px; width: 401px; " /></div><br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">When the large server market diminished in the 1990s, DEC suffered, was sold to Compaq in 1998, and Compaq successfully took the Alpha to all new levels by continuing its development.  But when HP bought Compaq in 2002, they stopped all development on Alpha and eventually retired its support a few years later.  Too bad - it truly was an amazing platform!<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Thinking Machines CM-5<br /></p>

                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Sun UltraSPARC<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Scalable Processor Architecture (SPARC) was a 32-bit RISC architecture developed by Sun Microsystems in 1987 and was eventually used to replace the Motorola 68000 architecture that Sun used in their computers.  SPARC turned out to be a great hit in the early 1990s because it performed very very well, and Sun released the 64-bit UltraSPARC RISC platform in 1995.  The Ultra in UltraSPARC actually referred to “64-bit”, but when it came to performance, “Ultra” really meant “Ultra” - whether it was the way that Sun designed their lines of UltraSPARC servers or the design of the CPU itself, Sun servers were amazing performers in the 1990s for their price.  When the dot-com bubble burst in 2001, the market was flooded with a ton of Sun servers because that is pretty much what everyone used on the Internet to host their content/apps. <br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 218px; width: 189px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 218px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 12px; position: relative; width: 189px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_3 inline-block stroke_0 shadow_8"><img src="26_Entry_1_files/droppedImage_8.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 218px; width: 189px; " /></div><br /></div>
                <p class="Body">The Sun Enterprise 450 server shown to the right was from about that same time - it has 4 UltraSPARC II CPUs, 4GB of RAM and 20 Ultra-wide SCSI hard drives.  We had a couple of these at the University of Waterloo that we weren’t using for a few months, so we dedicated them to doing SETI calculations - within weeks, they were in the top 20 list on SETI for the world!  Now, I use this one in my class as a file server.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">What makes me love the UltraSPARC platform is not the amazing performance, but that its hardware design has been open-sourced and improved upon to make the world’s best server processor today!  The UltraSPARC T2 CPU released in 2007 has 8 cores that can run 64 threads simultaneously!  Plus, it has integrated on-chip I/O and networking for virtualization as well as crypto-accelerators to speed up encryption/decryption (common on servers today).  You can’t bog one of these puppies down!  But the best part is that it runs on one-tenth of the electricity of a modern Intel Xeon CPU!  The electricity and cooling savings for a server data centre are huge!  If that isn’t enough for you, this year they just released the UltraSPARC T3, which is like the T2, but with 16 cores that can execute a whopping 128 threads simultaneously!  Hands down, when it comes to server platforms, UltraSPARC takes the cake!<br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style">AMD Opteron<br /></p>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="Body">Just as the Xeon is a high-end server-class Intel CPU, the Opteron is a high-end server-class AMD CPU.  Opterons are less expensive than Intel CPUs, and until the introduction of the Core2Duo, they were considerably more powerful (now they are about the same).  Many data centers are built around Opteron blade servers because the Opteron introduced power-efficiency early on (without sacrificing performance), and they got a head start in the early part of the decade because the Intel Pentium 4 Xeon sucked ass (no competition there).   I love the AMD Opteron platform as much as the Intel platform - if I had to choose between the two, I’d have to carefully weigh all of the specs available from the manufacturer (Dell, HP, IBM, etc.) before making a final decision.</p>
