    <richText>&lt;b&gt;For those who don&#x2019;t know what KRYPTOS is (likely because you haven&#x2019;t read Dan Brown ;-), it is a sculpture at the CIA that contains 4 encrypted messages.&#xA0; The first three have been cracked back in the 1990s, but the last one is a bitch because it depends on clues left in the first three.&#xA0; I bought the mini KRYPTOS replica from the Spy Museum website a while ago and sometimes like to take a stab at it when I need stress relief.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cracking any cryptography is a combination of several things:&#xA0; &#xD;Analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; - Looking at the problem in different ways to see if there is an interesting relationship or pattern.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; - Looking for relationships between the meaning of the deciphered data as well as the possible methods used to encrypt the data (in this case, a 16th-century method developed by a Frenchman).&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modeling&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; - Taking stabs at calculating data from what you have researched and analyzed earlier - for me, this usually involves mapping key things out on a spreadsheet and then writing a program to remap the data to see if it has any kind of meaning (or interesting relationships that hint that I am on the right track).&#xA0; After modeling hundreds of times, you might get lucky and eventually crack the code - so you must be quite tenacious to like this kind of stuff.&#xA0; And I am uber-tenacious (a fancy way of saying anti-social).&#xD;&#xD;Anywho, the artist who designed the sculpture has recently been disappointed that no one has cracked KRYPTOS yet, so he released a hint today in The New York Times (the 20th anniversary of the sculpture).&#xA0; You can find the hint here: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/20/us/code.html?ref=us"&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/20/us/code.html?ref=us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;&#xD;Of course, what the hell have I been doing all day?&#xA0; Working on this thing, because I have no life and can prove it mathematically.&#xA0; The hint was a big one - letters 64-69 decode to &#x201C;BERLIN&#x201D; - when you compare this to the original text, you will notice two original identical letters (T) that map to the last two letters in BERLIN.&#xA0; This usually indicates a phase shift of the cipher.&#xA0; After taking a look at possible phase shifts, I noticed that EVERY phase shift that is of interest is exactly 6 positions, including the purposeful typos in the previous 3 sections.&#xA0; For example, iqlusion, which should be illusion - &#x201C;q&#x201D; is a 6 phase shift of the letter &#x201C;l&#x201D;.&#xA0; So, I&#x2019;ve been building some simulations today that will hopefully tell me more about this &#x201C;6&#x201D; relationship in the data.&#xA0; I just started compiling the simulation and will run it soon and dump the results into SPSS tomorrow morning and analyze the results all day tomorrow.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Yes, I have no life, but I like this kind of stuff - it&#x2019;s food for the mind.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
