    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I&#x2019;m currently finishing the 3rd edition of my Guide To Linux Certification for Cengage.&#xA0; In Chapter 7, I used the following text from Shakespeare in the section on the stream editor (sed):&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two households, both alike in dignity,&#xD;In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,&#xD;From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,&#xD;Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.&#xD;From forth the fatal loins of these two foes&#xD;A pair of star-cross&#x2019;d lovers take their life;&#xD;Whole misadventured piteous overthrows&#xD;Do with their death bury their parents&#x2019; strife.&#xD;The fearful passage of their death-mark&#x2019;d love,&#xD;And the continuance of their parents&#x2019; rage,&#xD;Which, but their children&#x2019;s end, nought could remove,&#xD;Is now the two hours&#x2019; traffic of our stage;&#xD;The which if you with patient ears attend,&#xD;What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;I originally grabbed that passage from the Internet (copy-and-paste is easier than typing), but the technical editor caught a typo (Whole misadventured piteous overthrows should be Whose misadventured piteous overthrows).&#xA0; I verified it on the Internet and just thought it was one of those weird Olde English things, but the copyeditor verified it as a typo (she has an English degree) and also found out that it was a simple transcription typo (Whose --&gt; Whole) that managed to spread quickly across the Internet because most people prefer to copy-and-paste Shakespeare rather than type it out manually!&#xA0; Hilarious.&#xD;&#xD;I would normally chalk this up to an Internet-related phenomenon, but this type of thing has happened long before the Internet.&#xA0; One example is my 1st year Physics prof at the University of Waterloo (Ken Woolner), who purposefully tried to test the gullibility of the scientific community.&#xA0; Scientific units are only capitalized if they are named after someone (e.g. Hz = Hertz).&#xA0; However L (Litre) is capitalized only because it looks like the number 1 otherwise.&#xA0; So he published an article entitled &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Life and times of Claude &#xC9;mile Jean-Baptiste Litre&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &#x2013; it made it into most North American textbooks before he announced his clever hoax.&#xA0; However, you can still find the fictitious Claude &#xC9;mile Jean-Baptiste Litre in many places today including Encyclopedia Brittanica and Collier&#x2019;s Encyclopedia.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
