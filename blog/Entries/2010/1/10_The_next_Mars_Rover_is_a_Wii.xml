    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I thought of writing this post when I was talking with a friend of mine at a dinner party this weekend.&#xA0; Being a science geek, I have always followed anything NASA has ever done, including the ultra cool Mars Rovers.&#xD;&#xD;The first two Mars Rovers (Mars-2 Prop-M and Mars-3 Prop-M) both failed to reach Mars in 1971 (crash and burn!). &#xD;&#xD;The Mars Pathfinder Rover (a.k.a. Sojourner) actually made it to Mars in 1997, but failed after a few months.&#xA0; For computation, it had a radiation-hardened Intel 8085 CPU (variant of the 8088 used in PCs during the 1980s).&#xD;&#xD;The Mars Rovers launched in 2004 (Spirit MER-A and Opportunity MER-B) are still roving around Mars today!&#xA0; They run with a radiation-hardened IBM RAD6000 PowerPC RISC CPU (similar to the PowerPC 604e).&#xD;&#xD;Based on their blazing success with Spirit and Opportunity, NASA is launching a new Mars Rover called Curiosity MSL in 2011, which is considerably bigger than its predecessors, and contains a radiation-hardened IBM PowerPC 750 CPU.......the same CPU used in G3 Macintosh computers and the Nintendo Wii. Maybe they will use a Wiimote and Nunchuk controller to navigate it.....&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
