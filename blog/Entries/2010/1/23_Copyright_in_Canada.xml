    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Thirty years ago, people bought music on a record....a tangible thing like any other item for sale in a store.&#xA0; Now, people can download information (text, music, movies, etc.) from the Internet effortlessly.&#xA0; This copying of information has threatened the business models of many large and powerful companies such as music labels and movie producers.&#xA0; And these companies have reacted to their shrinking profits by abusing copyright and suing their customers rather than changing their business models.&#xD;&#xD;As a result, in today&#x2019;s digital age, I believe it important that everyone advocate information freedom and become educated regarding copyright laws.&#xA0;&#xA0; In general, I encourage everyone to attend public talks regarding copyright issues (or any other topic that interests them).&#xD;&#xD;On Monday, I attended a talk at the University of Waterloo by Sam Troscow entitled &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Copyright Debate: Finding the Right Balance for Teaching, Research, and Cultural Expression&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xA0; Sam did an amazing job, and I found that the information in this session filled many gaps in my own understanding, as well as complimented Richard Stallman&#x2019;s copyright talk last year at the University of Waterloo.&#xD;&#xD;Copyright involves the sole rights to reproduce a work (e.g. copy/upload) by the owner of the work (not the author of the work). Those who copy a work without the consent of the owner of the work are infringing the copyright.&#xA0; It is important to note that copyright protects the expression of a work and not the ideas within the work.&#xA0; For example, you can&#x2019;t copyright a musical note such as B flat, but you can copyright a song made up of musical notes.&#xD;&#xD;Sam argues that copyright often impedes teaching, innovation, and creative expression on many levels.&#xA0; In Canada, organizations such as Access Copyright (formerly CANCOPY....or CANTCOPY :-) charge education institutions and libraries a large amount of money that is distributed in questionable ways to copyright owners.&#xA0; To read periodicals/journals, a typical university pays about $4 to $5 million/year to Access Copyright.&#xD;&#xD;Moreover, the Canadian definition of copyright is vague, and there is a certain amount of implied consent for copying by the owner of copyrighted work.&#xA0; For example, by having a Print button on a Web page, a Select All feature in a program, or access to photocopy devices, a certain amount of common use can be expected by the owner (somewhat the same as implied consent).&#xD;&#xD;The most important part of Sam&#x2019;s talk involved Section 29 of the Canadian Copyright Act, which examines an important exception to copyright infringement: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fair dealing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&#xD;&#xD;Fair dealing (called Fair use in the U.S.) allows individuals or organizations to legally copy and use original works for criticism, review, news reporting, and private study or research. &#xD;&#xD;Moreover, the court also states that the availability of a license is not relevant to deciding whether a dealing has ben fair.&#xA0; This means that license agreements cannot be used to negate fair use in Canada (however, license agreements can negate fair use in the U.S.!).&#xD;&#xD;Better yet, the Supreme Court of Canada in 2004 clarified its position on copyright in the CCH vs LSUC case as follows:&#xA0; &#x201C;Excessive control by holders of copyrights and other forms of intellectual property may unduly limit the ability of the public domain to incorporate and embellish creative innovation in the long-term interests of society as a whole, or create practical obstacles to proper utilization.&#x201D;&#xA0; They also gave libraries the freedom to always claim fair use on behalf of their users in this case!&#xA0; This is one of those things that make me proud to be Canadian.&#xD;&#xD;To read more about Fair dealing, visit &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
