    <richText>&lt;b&gt;OK - so Apple released the new Intel Macs this month and shocked everyone with their amazing speed improvements.&#xA0; But what I noticed is that Apple didn&#x2019;t create a whole new look for them - essentially, the new line is in the same beautiful package as the iMac G5 and PowerBook.&#xA0; These designs must be very good if Apple is going to stick with them, and as a result, are key turning points in Mac evolution.&#xA0;&#xA0; Does evolutionary theory apply to computers.&#xA0; I think so.&#xA0; As I am sure the famous Richard Dawkins would point out, there must be some point where we could trace the current models of computers back to common motherboard architecture....&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
