    <richText>&lt;b&gt;The old expression &#x201C;Mac users usually swear by their computers.....Windows users typically swear at their computers&#x201D; got to me last week when my instructor computer&#x2019;s Windows desktop and applications froze 3 times at the beginning of class.&#xA0; As a result, my Terminal Services connection (that I use to record daily quiz marks) was destroyed each time.&#xA0; So I brought an old iMac G3 with OS X Tiger into my classroom this week and put it on a switch box so that I can use it to record marks across Terminal Services (OS X doesn&#x2019;t crash) while keeping my instructor computer free for classroom use.&#xA0;&#xA0; On the plus side, it also allows me to demonstrate the portability of the commands that I am teaching in my Linux Administration class next week and it looks good at the front of the room - I was never a big fan of the G3 iMacs when they first came out because they ran OS 9, but I must admit that they are sleek looking computers :)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
