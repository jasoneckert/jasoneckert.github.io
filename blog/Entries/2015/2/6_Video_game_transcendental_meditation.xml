    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Chances are, you read the title of this post and thought something along the lines of &#x201C;Seriously?!?  What do video games have to do with meditation?&#x201D;&#xD;&#xD;Well, if you did think this, then I hope that you&#x2019;ll be enlightened after reading this post ;-)&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is transcendental meditation?&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transcendental meditation is the most commonly practiced form of meditation in the world.  People who practice it often listen to, or repeat, a particular sound or mantra in order to reach a relaxed state of consciousness.  It&#x2019;s been praised by many for decades as a means of lowering stress and anxiety.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is a &#x201C;flow state&#x201D; within a video game?&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video games that require quick thinking, fast reflexes and precision are often difficult to excel at - but with practice, the game can be mastered.  When mastered, the player&#x2019;s physical precision is almost effortless (encoded in &#x201C;muscle memory&#x201D;), the the thought processes seem perfectly natural.  It&#x2019;s as if your mind is actually &#x201C;in&#x201D; the game.  This state is often called &#x201C;the zone&#x201D; by gamers, or a &#x201C;flow state&#x201D; by psychologists.&#xD;&#xD;Joel West describes what a flow state is like in the 2007 documentary &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chasing Ghosts: Beyond the Arcade&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;When you play a video game, there are days when it&#x2019;s fighting you.  Then there are days when you and the game become &#x201C;one&#x201D; - you&#x2019;re fluid, you&#x2019;re focused, you&#x2019;re with the game.  You&#x2019;re right there with it, and everything is right - there&#x2019;s nothing that is wrong, and you can&#x2019;t even hear what&#x2019;s going on outside of your realm, you&#x2019;re so focused. There&#x2019;s nothing.  It&#x2019;s very much a spiritual experience.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The simple arcade games from the late 1970s and early 1980s, such as Pac-man and Galaga, are often good examples of games that require quick thinking, fast reflexes and precision.  However, there are many other games today that also contain the same ingredients - the key is to avoid games that spur emotion, require varied thinking, or are comprised mainly of unpredictable elements. For example, first person shooters that are played across a network are poor for creating a flow state since those games often rely on changing pace, emotional story elements, and the unpredictability of other player opponents. &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comparing a video game flow state to transcendental mediation:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;A flow state within a video game is very similar to the relaxed state of consciousness achieved by transcendental meditation - the world around you disappears, and your thought processes are focused effortlessly.&#xD;&#xD;Moreover, the repeated recital of mantras in transcendental meditation (e.g. &#x201C;so...hum...&#x201D;) mimics the physical patterns that are ultimately encoded into muscle memory through repetition when mastering a video game.  Both allow the mind to de-focus on the outside world, and focus on a higher sense of consciousness in a relaxing way.  For those who meditate, this higher sense of consciousness allows them to put their sense of being into focus, and for those who achieve a flow state while playing a video game, it allows them to put the challenges presented by the game into focus and complete them with ease.  &#xD;&#xD;Finally, both transcendental meditation and the process of achieving a flow state within a video game provide the same end result.  As Joel West eluded to at the end of his quote, there is a profound sense of satisfaction and relaxation after experiencing a flow state during a video game.  And this parallels the satisfaction and relaxation that comes to people after practicing transcendental meditation.&#xD;&#xD;So, the next time your significant other complains that you&#x2019;re spending too much time playing video games, be sure to tell them that you are, in fact, trying to achieve relaxation and focus through transcendental mediation.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
