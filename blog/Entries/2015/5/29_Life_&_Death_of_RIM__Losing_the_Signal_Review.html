                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Like any corporate biography, it starts from the beginning by discussing the historical roots of mobile technology, followed by the background of RIM’s two leaders (<span class="style_2">Mike Lazaridis</span> and <span class="style_2">Jim Basillie</span>) and their uphill struggle in the 1990s to keep RIM alive.  It also details how the BlackBerry came to be and why it rose to prominence, as well as the factors and events that transformed RIM into a small shadow of its former self.<br /></p>

Unlike Palm, Nokia and Microsoft, Lazaridis didn’t think that combining computing, phone and Internet in the late 1990s was a good long-term approach (it sucked batteries dry, required too much bandwidth and was awkward with the screen technology of the time).  Instead, he pushed a “less not more” approach, which worked well for getting people hooked to mobile email as well as appease carriers that didn’t want to relay tons of data.  It also kept the relatively-unused Mobitex network alive in North America.<br /></p>

Suddenly, it was all about portable computing and apps - battery life and data compression didn’t matter anymore.  Consumers now drove the market. RIM didn’t “get” this until it was far far too late.  Lazaridis was preaching that consumers cared about security, reliability and multitasking, when Steve Jobs was preaching style, content and ease of use.<br /></p>

They bought QNX in hopes that the QNX OS would save their aging BlackBerry OS. <br /></p>

                <p class="Body">My first “real” BlackBerry was the iconic 7250 (shown right), and I loved it.  I’ve also had a BlackBerry Curve, World Edition, and Bold 2.  By the time I had a Bold 2, BlackBerry was becoming seriously antiquated in the tech market, and I longed for an iPhone or Android phone.  Today, I’m and Android user.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">While I loved their technology, I hated the company.  I got first hand exposure to RIM bureaucracy during our academic relationship - there were some people we dealt with at RIM that we not-so-affectionately called “RIMtards” for incredibly good reasons.  I remember telling my boss that their bureaucratic culture would ultimately kill them in the tech market when Apple and Google decide to heat up the competition.  Years later, he mentioned something along the lines of “You totally called that one.”<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">In short, times change - the backend server infrastructure that ultimately allowed RIM to create fast compressed/encrypted email and messaging services in the early/mid 2000s became a white elephant on their back by the late 2000s.....and ultimately led to the big service disruption in 2011 that was the nail in the coffin for so many IT managers.  By the late 2000s, Android and iPhone smartphones were app-running computers that connected to the fast mobile Internet of the time to access the Internet like any home PC.  The definition of mobile computing changed - it grew up - and RIM was left in the dust because they were too bureaucratic to innovate, and didn’t think they could be toppled in the first place.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">It’s a problem that has traditionally plagued Canadian tech companies - they don’t “get” that after you reach a certain size, that you have to constantly reinvent yourself to match the tech market and remain viable.  There isn’t a lot of Silicon Valley in the founders of RIM or the corporate culture that they created.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body">On a closing note, there is one interesting thing that I was reminded of while reading this book - during RIMs decline, the entire region where I live (Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario) was populated with a disproportionately large number of RIM supporters/advocates/apologizers.  <div style="height: 185px; width: 276px;  clear: right; float: right; height: 185px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 12px; position: relative; width: 276px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_3 inline-block shadow_1"><img src="29_Life_%26_Death_of_RIM__Losing_the_Signal_Review_files/droppedImage_1.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 186px; width: 276px; " /></div><br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="Body">It felt like a fucking cult.  If you said something bad about the company, there would be a dozen people down your throat with pissed off expressions (example shown right) telling you how BlackBerry is better than iOS/Android or how you should be supporting Canadian technology. Thankfully, those idiots are few and far between today ;-)</p>
