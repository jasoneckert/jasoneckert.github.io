    <richText>&lt;b&gt;This is the first year that I&#x2019;ve been to the World of Commodore event (a yearly gathering of Commodorks).  In fact, I had no idea that it even existed until someone I knew told me about it.....and since it&#x2019;s relatively close to me, I just had to go.  And I&#x2019;m glad I did.&#xD;&#xD;It wasn&#x2019;t a huge event, but there was plenty to see and buy there - my favorite was the Commodore 64 Wi-Fi card as shown below:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;There was lots of software and hardware for sale too - the coolest thing I picked up for myself was a NOS (new old stock) Epyx joystick (the best joystick ever made) - it can be used on both Commodore and Atari machines:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;I even picked up a cool World of Commodore t-shirt and duffle bag:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Overall - it was a great event, and I plan on going again next year (after all, I DO have a lot of Commodore computers in my vintage computer collection....even if I don&#x2019;t turn them on regularly ;-)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
