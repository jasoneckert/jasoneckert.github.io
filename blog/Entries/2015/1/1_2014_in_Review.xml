    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I think it&#x2019;s always a good idea each New Year&#x2019;s Day to reflect on the events that happened during the previous year - it&#x2019;s a great way to remember some of the great things that have happened, as well as put some of the not-so-great things that have happened in perspective. If you regularly post to social media (e.g. Facebook or Twitter), looking back on your posts are a great way to revisit the major events that took place during the year. Better yet, by summarizing them in a blog post (as I&#x2019;m doing here), you&#x2019;ll preserve those events for posterity and make it easy to revisit them in distant years too!&#xD;&#xD;Here are some of the coolest things from my 2014 year:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;	&#x2022;	I got some cool movie props from the set of the movie &#x201C;Pixels&#x201D; coming out in 2015 (including a Dig Dug arcade machine!)&#xD;	&#x2022;	I spent a LOT of time this summer going for walks and playing &#x201C;kick-ball&#x201D; with my dog Pepper (shown right) in the park behind our house - what a great summer!&#xD;	&#x2022;	I got new furniture for the living room (retro-style) and a Daft Punk print for over the piano&#xD;	&#x2022;	I finished the 4th edition of my best-selling Linux+ textbook for Cengage&#xD;	&#x2022;	I saw &#x201C;Les Miserables&#x201D; at the Dunfield Theatre in Cambridge - my favorite musical!&#xD;	&#x2022;	I won 2 different awards for academic achievement!&#xD;	&#x2022;	I got the coolest computer in the world: the 6-core Mac Pro tube (the aluminum shell doesn&#x2019;t even smudge when you kiss it goodnight)&#xD;	&#x2022;	Went to the Science of Rock &amp; Roll exhibition at the Ontario Science Centre with my daughter Mackenzie&#xD;	&#x2022;	I restored a full-sized upright Galaga arcade machine, a full-sized upright Robotron 2084 arcade machine, a Ms.Pac-man upright cabaret arcade, an Asteroids upright cabaret arcade, a Centipede cocktail arcade, and a Space Invaders cocktail arcade (six games I absolutely love), and I&#x2019;ve still got some more arcade projects on the go!&#xD;	&#x2022;	I coordinated and attended the Great Canadian Appathon 4 and the Microsoft Imagine Cup Camp events at our Kitchener campus - both events were a blast!&#xD;	&#x2022;	Reorganized and updated my website to streamline the information and make it easier to browse&#xD;	&#x2022;	I read some amazing books throughout the year!&#xD;	&#x2022;	I remodeled my games room (rec room) to be nothing short of EPIC!&#xD;	&#x2022;	I took my mom to Mother&#x2019;s Pizza (a great restaurant that just opened again after 20 years) for Mother&#x2019;s Day&#xD;	&#x2022;	I managed to digitize my entire printed photo collection (from before the days of digital cameras)&#xD;	&#x2022;	I blew up a lot of shit playing RAIDEN, RAIDEN 2, and RAIDEN Fighters Jet 2000: Operation Hell Dive on my arcade machines (RAIDEN games rock!)&#xD;	&#x2022;	I enjoyed good coffee on my front porch sunroom most mornings&#xD;	&#x2022;	I got to know many of my more distant neighbors at a potluck party another neighbor organized - the people in my neighborhood are awesome!&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;I spent much of this year thinking that it wasn&#x2019;t as cool as 2013. mainly because I did the ultra-cool Game ON 2.0 stuff at the Ontario Science Centre for most of 2013.  But now that I look back on all the great things that have happened in 2014, I&#x2019;m thinking that 2014 was just as good or better than 2013! &#xD;&#xD;Here&#x2019;s to 2015 being even better!  Although, I&#x2019;m sure that Grumpy Cat would disagree.....;-)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
