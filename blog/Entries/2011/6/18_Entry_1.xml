    <richText>&lt;b&gt;We are in &#x201C;A Gadget Age&#x201D; - well, at least that is what Leo Laporte has called it.&#xA0; I have a different name for it that you saw in this post&#x2019;s title that I&#x2019;ll explain now....&#xD;&#xD;When you walk around today, people are carrying gadgets of all types: smartphones, tablets, iPods, GPSes, etc.&#xA0;&#xA0; Moreover, new gadgets are all the rave - people eagerly await the next Apple product or cool gadget that will &#x201C;allow you to do everything&#x201D; (they even talk about it in their own social circles).&#xD;&#xD;My step-brother Andrew is currently in medical school, and uses a MacBook to type notes from class.&#xA0; It is much quicker than shorthand, which allows you to get everything the prof says, as well as easy to edit/revise afterwards.&#xA0;&#xA0; He told me that many of his classmates are scribbling poor-looking notes on their iPads (because everyone MUST have an iPad) and then collating them at home.&#xA0; This is what drawn notes look like on an iPad:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;In short, the general public is well-gadgeted......but I wonder how well those gadgets are being used.......&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;I&#x2019;m a technologist, but I&#x2019;m not a gadgeteer.&#xA0; What is the difference?&#xA0; Simple.&#xA0; Technologists are always aware of the fact that a piece of technology is not important within itself - it is the expression of that technology that is important.&#xA0; For example, I&#x2019;m sure that the microbiologists who discovered Telomerase and its link to cancer were not thinking about the cool specs on the computers they used when tackling the problem.&#xA0; Instead, for them, technology was a tool to achieve something important, and they simply found and used whatever was available at the time to solve a puzzle that consumed their thoughts.&#xD;&#xD;Gadgeteers, on the other hand, believe that technology will allow them to do great things somehow.......sometime.......magically.&#xA0;&#xA0; That is why they keep getting the latest and greatest gadget that does something previous gadgets don&#x2019;t do.&#xA0;&#xA0; Never mind the creativity.....&#xD;&#xD;Unfortunately, gadgeteerism is so rampant in society today that it is considered a social norm.&#xA0; And what do we have to show for it - a ton of people who express themselves based on the technology available at the time.&#xA0; This is why you saw teenagers with personal cell phones a decade ago talking everywhere, and why you see teenagers today with smartphones texting each other everywhere.&#xA0; They aren&#x2019;t thinking about what they are doing - they are just doing it because they have the gadget.&#xA0; View this sample &#x201C;typical&#x201D; dialog using smartphone texting and ask yourself whether you see these people doing anything important in the future such as discovering a cure for cancer:&#xD;Friend1: heyyy&#xD;Friend2: heyyyyyyyyyyyyy&#xD;Friend1: HEYYYYYYYYY&#xD;Friend2: yo&#xD;Friend1: yo yo&#xD;Friend2: dawg you be killing my happiness&#xD;Friend1: how?&#xD;Friend2: idk. its juss the way you are&#xD;Friend1: omg, lol. sooooo......&#xD;Friend2: so&#xD;Friend1: so?&#xD;Friend2: omg guess what&#xD;Friend1: what?&#xD;Friend2: I'M GOD&#xD;Friend1: haha...wait what&#xD;Friend2: i said.....I'M GOD&#xD;Friend1: umm, is there a doctor in the house?&#xD;Friend2: i dont need a doctor i already medicated myself with retardism&#xD;Friend1: i figured tht out on my own&#xD;Friend2: lol oh and your bruce almighty&#xD;Friend1: ummmmm&#xD;Friend2: NOW MAKE SOUP DISAPPEAR DANG IT!!!!&#xD;Friend1: hahahaha&#xD;Friend2: did you do it?&#xD;Friend1: do what?&#xD;Friend2: MAKE SOUP DISAPPEAR&#xD;Friend1: haaaaaa&#xD;Friend2: did you!&#xD;Friend1: haha nope&#xD;Friend2: WELL WHY NOT!!???!!!??&#xD;Friend1: i dont have any soup&#xD;Friend2: then pee in the toilet and make that disappear&#xD;Friend1: um ok?&#xD;Friend2: did it disappear?&#xD;Friend1: no brooke, it didnt. haha ur so weird.&#xD;Friend2: so ive been told&#xD;&#xD;It&#x2019;s almost as if they are de-evolving (the English language is for sure ;-). &#xD;The real problem is that gadgeteerism promotes laziness and the &#x201C;I want it now&#x201D; mentality - both of which have also led to the general problem plaguing education today as I discussed in my &#x201C;Math education reform&#x201D; post last week.&#xA0; Sites like Facebook and Twitter have arisen because of this social gadgeteerism and not because they allow us to solve particular problems.&#xD;&#xD;In short, gadgeteerism is making society dumber.&#xA0; So a better term for today&#x2019;s age is &#x201C;The Age of Technical Stupidity.&#x201D;&#xA0; Jaron Lanier (who coined &#x201C;Virtual Reality&#x201D;) makes similar points in his book &#x201C;You Are Not A Gadget&#x201D; (a good read if you want to explore this topic in more depth).&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
