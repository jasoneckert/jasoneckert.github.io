    <richText>&lt;b&gt;That may seem like a bold statement.&#xA0; And it is.&#xA0; However, Apple said the same thing about the floppy in 1997 when they introduced the iMac without it, and it slowly disappeared afterwards.&#xA0; ZDnet said the same thing about optical media (CDs/DVDs) in 2009 when USB flash drives reached critical mass - and of course optical media is slowly disappearing as we speak (the DVD drive in my Alienware laptop died shortly after I got it, but I never called Dell to replace it because I never use it anyways). &#xD;&#xD;So I&#x2019;m going to say the same thing about hard drives right now.&#xA0; Why?&#xA0; Because I can&#x2019;t see myself buying another one ever again after using an SSD (Solid State Drive) that I won at the DIG conference several weeks ago.&#xD;&#xD;SSDs store information in NAND flash chips - as a result, the storage and retrieval of information is lightning fast and there are no moving parts that can be damaged if the computer is jolted or dropped.&#xA0;&#xA0; The bad news: they are still extremely expensive for the storage capacity that you get.&#xA0; For example, an Intel 320 Series 80GB SSD will run you $218 at the Futureshop right now, whereas a 7200rpm 2TB hard drive (which is 25 times the capacity!!!) will cost you about $200.&#xA0; This massive cost difference is why I never thought about buying an SSD until now.&#xD;&#xD;However, after installing the SSD into my computer and realizing how ultra fast it was, I can&#x2019;t go back to hard drives.&#xA0; I booted Fedora 16 with a ton of services enabled in exactly 3 seconds.&#xA0; Windows 7 boots in about the same time, and Microsoft Office opens immediately without even displaying the splash screen.&#xA0; I had no idea how much the speed of my storage device impacted the actual speed of my computer and applications.&#xD;&#xD;So, I think that hard drives will become a thing of the past very soon.&#xA0; Many hard drive manufacturers are making &#x201C;hybrid&#x201D; hard drives that use some NAND flash to speed up read/write time for a small increase in price.&#xA0; I think people will buy these drives, enjoy the moderate speed increase, then progress to buy an SSD, and realize that they can&#x2019;t go back to hard drives.&#xA0; As more people do this, the prices of SSDs will continue to drop, and then hard drives will be a thing of the past.&#xA0; Give it a few years......I think it will come to pass....&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
