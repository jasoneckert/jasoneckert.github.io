    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Bet you haven&#x2019;t seen a system like the one in the picture above (or recently at least)....but back in the 1980s and early 1990s, these things were all over the place, especially in universities and scientific/engineering organizations.&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;What you are looking at is a VMS (Virtual Memory System) operating system running on a DEC Alpha computer.&#xA0;&#xA0; I mentioned DEC in a few previous posts, but someone asked me to post a screenshot of what it was like, so here it is.&#xD;&#xD;Back in the old days (the 1980s), this operating system ran all over the place on DEC VAX (Virtual Address eXtension) computers.&#xA0; They weren&#x2019;t that flashy, and they had their own unique command line interface that will seem foreign today - for example, here is a nice snippet from Phil Ottewell&#x2019;s VMS tutorial:&#xD;&#xD;EXAMP :== "SYS$EXAMPLES:"&#xD;COPY 'EXAMP'LIBTEST1.FOR VAXLIB1.FOR&#xD;COPY 'EXAMP'LIBTEST2.FOR VAXLIB2.FOR&#xD;FORT VAXLIB1&#xD;FORT VAXLIB2&#xD;LIB/CREATE MYLIB VAXLIB2&#xD;LIB/LIST/FULL MYLIB &#xD;LINK VAXLIB1,MYLIB/LIB&#xD;RUN VAXLIB1&#xD;&#xD;You may be able to follow what is happening here - we first copy the files LIBTEST1.FOR and LIBTEST2.FOR from the SYS$EXAMPLES: directory to our current directory and call them VAXLIB1.FOR and VAXLIB2.FOR respectively.&#xA0; We then compile both FORTRAN files, convert VAXLIB2 into a library called MYLIB, inspect the library contents, link VAXLIB1 with this library and and RUN the resulting EXE file.&#xA0; Remember that FORTRAN was the only &#x201C;proven&#x201D; language in the scientific/engineering community until very recently!&#xD;&#xD;Similarly, files on a VMS system have a mandatory file extension and versioning information (you can have multiple versions of the same file) - for example, PROG.EXE;14 refers to the 14th version of the PROG.EXE file.&#xA0; You can also make aliases for certain files or directories (e.g. ASSIGN/NOLOG DEV$DISK:[JASON.ECKERT] JASON$DIR:) or copy files between VMS machines easily (e.g. COPY DEV$DISK:[JASON]TCM.TEX PDS$DISK:[BOB]).&#xA0; You get used to it.&#xD;&#xD;VMS influenced all other operating systems too!&#xA0; It was the first commercial OS to include integrated networking (DECnet and TCP/IP), support for multiple programming platforms (FORTRAN, C, C++, Ada, BLISS, etc.), distributed network file systems, rights management systems (RMS),&#xA0; multi-CPU hardware partitioning,&#xA0; NUMA multiprocessing, and network clustering (where multiple systems across the network share processing, disk storage, print queues, etc.).&#xD;&#xD;Anywho, VMS is still around!&#xA0; After the VAX days of the 1980s, VMS was used on DEC Alpha servers in the 1990s, until the mid 2000s.&#xA0; Now it runs on Itanium HP servers - the latest version is 8.4 (June 2010).&#xA0; That doesn&#x2019;t mean that you should run out and learn it anytime soon - VMS is only used in a small number of environments - but it is neat to see that it is still around.&#xA0; I used a lot of VMS boxes in the past, and I liked the system (it was very stable and fast), but I was more of a UNIX nut back then.&#xA0; I probably used VMS as much as UNIX, but most people religiously chose one platform or the other.&#xA0; In the late 1980s, if you put a bunch of VMS and UNIX admins in the same room, there would be bloodshed ;-)&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
