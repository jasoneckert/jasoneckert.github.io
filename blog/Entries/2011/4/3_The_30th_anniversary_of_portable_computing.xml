    <richText>&lt;b&gt;The first portable computer, the Osborne 1, was released April 3rd 1981 - exactly 30 years ago today!&#xD;&#xD;Although we think of portable today in the iPad sense, back in 1981, being able to actually carry a computer at all was a pretty amazing thing!&#xA0; My Osborne 1 (shown above) weighs 24 pounds and can be carried by its handle when packed up.&#xA0; You will notice that the keyboard doubles as a base, and attaches to the bottom with 4 heavy-duty clips for carrying.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;To use it, you detached the keyboard, exposing the front panel (which contained the dual 5.25&#x201D; floppy drives, ports, and 5&#x201D; monitor), plugged the keyboard in and turned it on!&#xD;&#xD;The Osborne 1 was finely crafted from heavy duty plastic and steel, which made it look superior to any computer of its day.&#xA0; Because it was built like a tank, and had very good specs for the time (4MHz Z80 processor, 64K memory, parallel/modem/serial ports, CP/M OS with lots of software), and a relatively cheap price tag ($1795US), it sold very well.&#xD;&#xD;I can definitely attest to the quality of the machine - my Osbone 1 still works today!&#xD;&#xD;The picture to the right is the Osborne 1 boot (early BIOS) screen that prompts you to insert a floppy in the first disk drive (A drive) to load.&#xA0; The writing is small (remember that it is a 5&#x201D; display), but when you are using a command line system about 1-2 feet away from the computer, it really doesn&#x2019;t matter.&#xD;&#xD;Below is Microsoft BASIC loaded from one of those old disks.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The Osborne 1 was also the last Osborne computer made - after a year on the market, Adam Osborne let people know prematurely that he was developing a new Osborne model - so people waited for the new one instead of buying the Osborne 1 (and you can&#x2019;t make new computers without constant cash flow!).&#xD;&#xD;Regardless, what the Osborne 1 did was introduce portable computing - it was quickly followed by the Kaypro, Compaq and IBM portable computers.&#xA0; But nothing was built quite like the Osborne 1 -&#xA0; I used a Kaypro, Compaq, and IBM portable for a while, but they lacked the cool looks, ease of use, and build quality of the original portable computer!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
