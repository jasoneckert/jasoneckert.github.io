    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Ever since the dawn of personal computing, people have been selecting computers to buy based on their specifications, or &#x201C;specs&#x201D;.&#xA0; Up until the early 2000s, most people have focused on the CPU that the computer had.&#xA0; Was it a MOS 6502 or Zilog Z80?&#xA0; Was it a 386 or 486?&#xA0; What it a Pentium 4 or Athlon?&#xA0; You get the picture.&#xD;&#xD;Like many others, I still do this today (can&#x2019;t help it), but the criteria has become much more complex, and there are far more factors and technologies that go into what makes a computer faster than just the CPU brand.&#xA0; Consequently, I actually enjoy performing the plethora of research about a new architecture or CPU implementation when it comes out (even though it take a good amount of time).&#xD;&#xD;I&#x2019;m not going to dedicate any time in this post to the latest desktop CPUs from Intel or AMD - instead, I&#x2019;d like to focus on the mobile CPUs that have proliferated in the last decade.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;In the 1990s, mobile CPUs consisted of either MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) or ARM (Acorn RISC Machine) - both CPUs were low-energy high-performance CPUs that use a similar RISC architecture, but design-wise, MIPS was far better than ARM.&#xA0; However, 90+ of all mobile CPUs today are ARM.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;It&#x2019;s the classic story of BETA vs VHS (BETA video cassette players were far better quality than their VHS counterparts in the 1980s, but since VHS was manufactured by hundreds of manufacturers, and only Sony manufactured BETA, VHS became the industry standard and BETA shrunk into obscurity).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Since the 1990s, ARM has received a massive amount of attention and development, and today ARM CPUs are extremely advanced and powerful as a result!&#xD;&#xD;Many different manufacturers produce ARM chips today for the hundreds of millions of mobile devices that are created each year.&#xA0;&#xA0; And if you buy a phone or a tablet, you will likely be drawn to the hardware specs since manufacturers love to say that they have better hardware than their competitors.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;There are 6 major ARM CPU platforms today - each one has announced &#x201C;bleeding-edge&#x201D; CPUs.&#xA0; The problem is that not all of these CPUs are implemented - whether a hardware manufacturer implements a particular ARM CPU depends on the cost, its software compatibility, its graphics acceleration features (or GPU), its speed, and its overall or &#x201C;real&#x201D; performance.&#xA0; Lets take a closer look:&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;Texas Instruments OMAP (Open Multimedia Application Platform) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;- This CPU has been around for some time and has enjoyed excellent development and reviews - it is currently the fastest ARM CPU implementation out there (but that could change any time).&#xA0; The latest implementations are usually dual core 1+ GHz with extremely powerful PowerVR graphics acceleration.&#xA0; It enjoys a moderate adoption (probably because it is relatively expensive compared to other ARM CPUs), and it has a very strong roadmap - you will find it in the Motorola Droid 2, B&amp;N Nook, and BlackBerry Playbook.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Samsung Hummingbird&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; - This ARM CPU is extremely close to the Texas Instruments OMAP in design and speed (1+ GHz), and also uses the latest PowerVR graphics acceleration.&#xA0; The only major difference is that it is currently implemented as a single-core CPU.&#xA0; You will find this in several Samsung phones (notably the Galaxy) and has extremely good performance in its implementation.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;Apple A4 and A5 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;- Like the Samsung Hummingbird, the A4 and A5 are extremely close to the Texas Instruments OMAP in design - they both run at 1GHz and have PowerVR acceleration.&#xA0; The difference is that the A4 is single-core, whereas the A5 is dual-core.&#xA0; The A4 is used in the iPhone and iPad, and the A5 is used in the iPad 2.&#xA0; If you own an iPhone or iPad, you already know that these are excellent performers!&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;Nvidia Tegra 2 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;- This dual-core CPU is top-notch when it comes to implementing the latest ARM instruction sets, having fast clock speeds, and implementing kick-ass graphics acceleration via their ULV (Ultra Low Power) GeForce GPU.&#xA0; It does cost more than most other ARM CPUs, so it has been adopted primarily in tablets and high-end phones.&#xA0; Spec-wise, I thought that the Tegra 2 would outperform all other ARM chips when it was announced - however, the Texas Instruments OMAP CPU still beats it today in nearly every category by a small margin.&#xA0; Still, the Tegra 2 is a very close 2nd.&#xA0; You will find it in the Motorola Atrix, Motorola Xoom, Samsung Galaxy Tab, and LG Optimus.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Qualcomm Snapdragon &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;- This ARM CPU has probably enjoyed the most adoption of any ARM CPU, and for good reason - it is quite fast (1+ GHz), and although most implementations are single-core, it has dual-core chips too.&#xA0; It uses a proprietary GPU called Adreno - the first Adreno 200 GPUs were technically a bit slower than ULV GeForce and PowerVR, but you&#x2019;d probably never notice since the Snapdragon is an extremely good performer in nearly all implementations - the later Adreno GPUs are as fast if not faster than ULV GeForce and PowerVR.&#xA0; The roadmap is awesome (quad core CPUs this year!), it is a bit cheaper than the OMAP or Tegra 2, and has excellent software tools and support.&#xA0; You will find this ARM CPU in a ton of phones and mobile devices from almost every manufacturer (Dell, HTC, Acer, Fujitsu, Samsung, Sony, LG, and much much more).&#xA0; Even the latest BlackBerry 7 devices have switched to using Qualcomm Snapdragons.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marvell PXA/Sheeva/Armada &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;- Marvell bought the XScale ARM architecture from Intel back in 2006 and have modified it heavily.&#xA0; Some of this modification was very good, but much of it made it more difficult to implement with other software and OSes as compared to other ARM CPUs - this is why RIM ditched Marvell for Qualcomm and Texas Instruments in their latest BlackBerry 7 phones (a very good move for RIM).&#xA0; On the performance side, they are the one CPU that performs far worse than all other ARM CPUs - Marvell has a weak roadmap (especially in the graphics or GPU area), and keeps much of its internal workings to itself, which makes it difficult to find detailed information on their CPUs without purchasing them first.&#xA0; Their high end Armada CPUs are rarely implemented, and their PXA/Sheeva CPUs are moderately implemented (mainly in older BlackBerries) and have low clock speeds (~600MHz).&#xD;&#xD;Now that we have discussed the different ARM CPU platforms out there today, I should add that the differences between the major ARM CPUs today is minor compared to the differences between the CPUs of the 1970s-1990s.&#xA0; Plus, you should keep in mind the difference between the &#x201C;actual&#x201D; performance of a CPU and the &#x201C;perceived&#x201D; performance of a CPU in a phone or mobile device - chances are that you probably won&#x2019;t notice much of a difference between different platforms for most things that you do.&#xA0; However, for larger tasks and applications, or for tablets, manufacturers will implement faster, dual-core CPUs with good graphics acceleration.&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Another problem is that the ARM architecture is a low-energy, RISC CPU whose ultimate performance depends on how it is integrated with other components.&#xA0; For example, the dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon in the recently discontinued HP Touchpad is a great CPU with excellent performance - but the performance of the HP Touchpad is absolutely dismal because the rest of the hardware was not designed properly to integrate with it.&#xA0; This was confirmed when a team took the WebOS from the Touchpad and hacked it to run on an iPad - they noticed that the performance doubled because it was running on well-designed (albeit slower) hardware!&#xD;&#xD;So, in summary, you gotta try it before you buy it.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
