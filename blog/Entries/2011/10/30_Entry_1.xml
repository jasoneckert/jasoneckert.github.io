    <richText>&lt;b&gt;This blog post is dedicated to the 10th anniversary of the Apple iPod this past week (Oct 23rd). So, why would I dedicate an entire blog entry to it?&#xA0; It&#x2019;s just a glorified MP3 player, right?&#xA0; Well, yes, it is a glorified MP3 player, but the iPod is more about changing the way we think about music and DRM than anything else.&#xD;&#xD;Like many new technologies, MP3 players really didn&#x2019;t make a splash until Apple pushed them.&#xA0; The original iPod hardware was amazing - a hard drive, easy-to-read interface, and touchy-scrolly wheel that controled it all.&#xA0; I love that wheel so much, that I refuse to buy a new iPod that doesn&#x2019;t have it - my 5th generation 80GB iPod Video is fine by me and still works like new!&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;However, it was the idea of using an iPod to play music that was really important.&#xA0; You could buy music and stick it on your iPod.&#xA0; You could transfer the music that you already bought and stick it on your iPod.&#xA0; And you could download pirated songs and put them on your iPod (like a massively big mix tape).&#xA0; Everyone bought iPods - the other MP3 manufacturers never stood a chance - especially when nearly all MP3 accessories (as well as stereos, clocks, cars, etc.) were made for the iPod.&#xA0; The iPod had momentum, and Steve Jobs used this momentum to change the way we think about digital music personally, as well as protect the major music labels from their own stupidity!&#xD;&#xD;When the big music labels realized that some people were downloading pirated songs (most people still bought music), they put DRM (Digital Rights Management) restrictions on everything and ran huge &#x201C;piracy is illegal&#x201D; ads everywhere.&#xA0; They tried to court other MP3 player manufacturers and create non-Apple music stores that had expensive-but-legitimate DRM-restricted music you could put on your non-Apple MP3 players.&#xA0; Did it work?&#xA0; Hell no.&#xD;&#xD;Apple, however, ensured that piracy was kept to a minimum by ensuring that the prices for individual songs on the iTunes music store were reasonable - 99&#xA2; per song.&#xA0; Cheap enough that kids could buy them, and feel good about not pirating.&#xA0; Nearly all kids today buy their songs on iTunes as a result!&#xA0; Those that don&#x2019;t have any money may pirate them, but there is nothing wrong with that - I believe that everyone should have access to the same information regardless of their wealth.&#xA0; When I was a kid, I copied cassette tapes for friends who couldn&#x2019;t afford to buy them.&#xA0; Now those same friends buy their own music!&#xD;&#xD;And for those who don&#x2019;t want to buy restricted music (e.g. myself), Steve Jobs made the content DRM-free.&#xA0;&#xA0; To do all of this, Steve Jobs basically gave the major record labels no choice: &#x201C;You either play by what the future wants, or you die&#x201D; was his ultimatum (not literally, but functionally).&#xA0; Those same music labels can thank Steve Jobs for saving them from a dishonorable downfall - can you imagine what today would be like otherwise?&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;That is the real reason the iPod was important: in less than 10 years, it transformed the way the music industry worked, and realigned it to what society wants for the future.&#xA0; It also proved that no matter how many stupid laws that restrict your personal freedom (e.g. the U.S. DMCA) are in existence, it really is consumers (and smart companies like Apple) that ultimately choose what is going to happen with digital media.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
