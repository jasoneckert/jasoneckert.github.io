    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Back in the late 1990s, a Canadian company called Research in Motion (RIM) released their first BlackBerry - it wasn&#x2019;t really called a BlackBerry back then - most people called it a two-way pager (even Dr. Evil called it a two-way in his prison rap song in the movie &#x201C;Austin Powers 3: Goldmember&#x201D;).&#xD;&#xD;It was a neat idea at the time because email was fast becoming a major business communication tool - the BlackBerry allowed you to read and reply to your email on a small pager device while you were away from your office PC.&#xA0; To do this, the first BlackBerry had a small keyboard as shown to the left in the picture above.&#xA0; And to ensure that your email was accessed in a &#x201C;safe and secure&#x201D; way, it was encrypted using the 3DES encryption algorithm (pretty strong for the late 1990s!) - after all, these expensive little devices were really geared to executives who were always concerned about the security of their communication.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;So how did it all work back then?&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Well, you had to install a program called the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;BlackBerry Desktop Redirector &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;on the PC in your company that you used to check your email (the PC that had Microsoft Outlook on it).&#xA0; Then, you plugged your BlackBerry into your PC using the supplied serial cable - when you did this, the BlackBerry Desktop Redirector contacted RIM&#x2019;s servers on the Internet and added a line that associated your particular BlackBerry with your PC.&#xA0; Next, it prompted you to wiggle your mouse randomly so that it could generate a 3DES encryption key from the random points on the screen that you were wiggling your mouse around.&#xA0;&#xA0; This 3DES encryption key was then stored on your PC and also transferred to your BlackBerry across the serial cable.&#xA0; You could then unplug your BlackBerry from your PC - any email that sent between your PC and BlackBerry from that point on was encrypted using this 3DES encryption key.&#xD;&#xD;In order for email to be sent back and forth between your PC and your BlackBerry, your PC had to be on all of the time and have Internet access!&#xA0; When a new email arrived on your PC from the Internet, the BlackBerry Desktop Redirector would encrypt the email and send it out to the servers at RIM.&#xA0; The servers at RIM would know that the email from your PC was destined for your BlackBerry and then forward it to the wireless carrier (Rogers, Bell, etc.) and it would get sent to your BlackBerry.&#xA0; Your BlackBerry would then decrypt the message and show it to you.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;If you replied to the message (or sent a new message), then your BlackBerry would encrypt the message, send it across the wireless carrier to the RIM servers, who would know that your BlackBerry is associated with your PC, and then forward the email to your PC (provided your PC was on and had Internet access).&#xA0; Your PC would then deliver the mail to whomever it needed to be delivered to.&#xD;&#xD;This is shown below:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Now, as companies started buying more and more BlackBerries, this sort of scheme wasn&#x2019;t too practical (imagine having 200 PCs in the company doing this!).&#xA0; So that is where a &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; came into the picture.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;So how does BES work today?&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since most companies have their own Email Server that all other PCs in the company connect to in order to send/receive email, the BES server simply replaces the BlackBerry Desktop Redirector.&#xA0; BES monitors all of the email accounts on the Email Server and when a new email arrives, it encrypts and sends a copy to the servers at RIM, which know the associated BlackBerry that should receive the email.&#xA0; The servers at RIM then forward the email to the wireless carrier and ultimately to the BlackBerry, where it is decrypted and displayed for the user.&#xA0;&#xA0; If you reply to the email or generate a new email on the BlackBerry, it gets sent to the servers at RIM, which know that your BlackBerry is associated with your BES server and the email gets forwarded to BES and then to your company&#x2019;s email Server.&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Of course, for all of this to work, each BlackBerry in the company must be manually associated to the right email account on the BES server (usually by plugging the BlackBerry into the BES server and associating it with the correct email account).&#xA0; This is called &#x201C;activating&#x201D; or &#x201C;provisioning&#x201D; a BlackBerry, and serves to generate the encryption key used to encrypt emails between the BES server and the BlackBerry (newer BlackBerries use the more advanced AES encryption algorithm instead of 3DES), as well as notify the servers at RIM so that they add a line to associate the particular BlackBerry with the correct BES server.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;What if I have a personal BlackBerry?&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you buy a BlackBerry for personal use, it obviously won&#x2019;t be activated on a BES server.&#xA0; Instead the servers at RIM simply access your Gmail/Yahoo/Hotmail/etc email accounts on your behalf (you must put in the login information for each account on your BlackBerry).&#xA0; Also, since there is no BES server or BlackBerry Desktop Redirector involved, there is no encryption of anything!&#xA0; The emails you send back and forth to your Gmail/Yahoo/Hotmail/etc accounts are never encrypted.&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
