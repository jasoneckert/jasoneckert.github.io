    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I think it fitting to mention DEC here because, although they were never a household term, they were one of the best computer companies of all time - we wouldn&#x2019;t have the Internet, UNIX, or TCP/IP without them!&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; was born in the late 1950s when it was lucrative to make computers that cost a ton of money.&#xA0; And DEC was good - they would make computers that would perform much better and cost significantly less than the IBM equivalent (IBM mainframes back then were expensive behemoths).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The DEC &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;PDP (Programmed Data Processor)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; line of minicomputers were so good and inexpensive, you&#x2019;d be hard pressed to NOT find one in your local university.&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;The PDP-7 was the first computer to run the infamous UNIX operating system.&#xD;&#xD;The PDP-10 was the first computer to introduce time sharing and TCP/IP implementation for the Internet (there were plenty of PDP-10 nodes on the early Internet, or ARPANET).&#xD;&#xD;The PDP-11 was the most influential and mass-produced minicomputer of its time that led to the creation of the C programming language as well as the designs of CP/M, DOS, and the Motorola 68000 architecture.&#xD;&#xD;Although PDPs were still sold in the 1980s (and early 1990s), they were largely considered obsolete by then.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;What took their place was the 32-bit DEC &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;VAX (Virtual Address Extension) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;computer (which was a 32-bit extension of the PDP-11).&#xA0; VAXen were extremely popular everywhere in the 1980s, but died off in the 1990s.&#xA0; For an operating system, they ran UNIX or VMS, but almost everyone I knew ran UNIX on them because it was faster and more flexible than VMS (although VMS did have some cool features such as network clustering and advanced file versioning).&#xD;&#xD;DEC knew in the 1980s that VAX&#x2019;s days were numbered since 32-bit platforms were quickly becoming commonplace.&#xD;They knew that they needed a radically new product if they wanted to stay viable into the 1990s, so they spent over a billion dollars in research and development and came up with an architecture that was unbelievably powerful yet backwards-compatible to VAX/PDP - that was the DEC Alpha AXP (or just &#x201C;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEC Alpha&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#x201D;), a 64-bit RISC CPU that ran at clock speeds 10 times that of other CPUs during the time.&#xA0; Although these computers were expensive, you got what you paid for - they were superb number crunchers, and the fastest computers in the world. &#xD;&#xD;&#xD;The DEC Alpha was DEC&#x2019;s ultimate product - their glory.&#xA0;&#xA0; It could run VMS, UNIX (several flavors), Linux (the DEC Alpha was the first non-i386 architecture to run Linux), and even Windows.&#xA0; Yes, you heard me correctly - it could run Windows - DEC added a special BIOS to the Alpha that allowed it to install and boot Windows NT4 or Windows 2000 (Beta).&#xA0; Here is a screenshot of one of my DEC Personal Workstations running Windows 2000:&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;Although Windows ran extremely fast on the Alpha (they even had Microsoft Office ported to Alpha too), Windows was a 32-bit operating system only - running it on a 64-bit Alpha was like putting a 4-cylinder engine inside a Cadillac Escalade.&#xA0;&#xA0; It is important to note that the Alpha hardware booted Windows using a special FAT partition that contained the osloader.exe boot loader program and hardware architecture details (HAL &amp; PALs) as shown in the screenshot above.&#xD;&#xD;Everyone in their right mind only ran UNIX or Linux on the DEC Alpha....&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;One of the coolest workstations that DEC came out with was called the Digital Ultimate Workstation (a.k.a. AlphaServer 1200) - it came out in 1997 and had two 533MHz 64-bit Alpha CPUs with 4MB of cache, 4GB of RAM, and 7 Ultrawide SCSI hard disks (hot-swappable) for a mere $80,000.&#xA0; I actually had 4 of these given to me by Compaq for use in research - the same machines were previously loaned out to a company called Digital Domain to create the graphics for the movie &#x201C;Titantic&#x201D;, and yes, they used Linux on them to do the work!&#xA0; I still have one of them (I use it to demonstrate RAID at the campus) - it is still kicking strong after 13 years (DEC hardware was always well-made).&#xD;&#xD;Of course, when I used them back in the day, I had Linux on them - and they ran Linux so blazingly fast that others couldn&#x2019;t believe it.&#xA0; Remember that in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Linux was still &#x201C;feeling&#x201D; its way into the world - many companies didn&#x2019;t treat it seriously back then - but when you saw it run on a DEC Alpha, you couldn&#x2019;t do anything but stare in awe.&#xA0; Below is a screenshot of Red Hat Linux running on one of my Digital Ultimate Workstations - the GIMP (powerful image manipulation software) is running in the foreground.&#xA0; While a typical system today takes about 2 minutes to do a complex light effect render using the GIMP today, the Digital Ultimate Workstation running Linux takes about 10 seconds (remember that the Alpha is a blazingly fast number cruncher):&#xD;&#xD;&#xD;So, this is why the DEC Alpha is often used in reference to well-designed or fast computers.&#xA0; However, by the 1990s, DEC was in a downwards spiral of mismanagement and had trouble capitalizing on the Alpha (they didn&#x2019;t have the know-how to market it properly), so they went bust in 1998 and were sold to Compaq, who continued Alpha development.&#xA0; Compaq did manage to market and sell Alphas very successfully (they sold more Alphas in 3 years than DEC did in 6 years).&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;However, when HP bought Compaq in 2002, HP immediately slated the Alpha architecture for retirement because they wanted to push the Itanium architecture (which they realized was a very poor decision in the end).&#xA0; By 2007, Alpha support had ceased everywhere, and HP was stuck with crappy high-end Itanium systems that sold poorly at best.&#xA0; If they would have stuck with the Alpha platform, they probably would have capitalized on a much larger portion of the high-end computing market like Compaq did. &#xD;&#xD;Of course, if DEC did not decline in the 1990s, we&#x2019;d probably still see the Alpha platform today as well.&#xA0; The decline of DEC is fascinating in its own right - but I&#x2019;ll save that for another blog post.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
