    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I know this sounds extremely lame, but on Wednesday August 3rd, I threw my back out playing Angry Birds.&#xA0; And each time I&#x2019;ve told people that, they&#x2019;ve either burst out laughing, gave me the quizzical look (as if I&#x2019;m joking), or simply state something along the lines of &#x201C;if it were to happen, it would have happened to you.&#x201D;&#xD;&#xD;I definitely plan on telling people that I threw my back out playing Angry Birds at future events (it is a great ice breaker for sure!).&#xA0; And if they ask about details, I&#x2019;ll refer them to this post......&#xD;&#xD;So here is how it happened:&#xD;&#xD;Did tons of gardening work the night before - whole body is sore as a result.&#xD;&#xD;Woke up and worked on my computer from home for most of the day, which involved responding to work emails and creating PowerPoint presentations to match our C++ Game Programming II textbook.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;My neck got sore pretty quickly from looking down at the textbook and back up at the computer screen all day long.&#xA0; This developed into a knot in my upper back, so I had my daughter walk on it, which cracked my spine back into place and completely relieved it.&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;My back is still somewhat sore at this point, so instead of going for my usual workout at the gym, I decide to take it easy for the rest of the night.&#xA0; So I flip on the BlackBerry Playbook and decide to see what all the hype is about with Angry Birds (I recently installed a copy of Angry Birds on it that some Russian developer ported from Android using the native SDK).&#xD;&#xD;Angry Birds turns out to be sort of boring at first, and then you get to some levels that take precise planning to complete - this mental challenge got me hooked and I spent the next 4 hours playing this dangerous game.&#xA0; Yes, I spent 4 consecutive hours looking down at the tablet in my lap.......not realizing what time it is or that I&#x2019;m taking my neck and spine out of whack.&#xA0; This created a condition called hyperflexion (forward whiplash).&#xA0; &#xD;&#xD;Then, for the umpteenth time, I failied to kill 1 stupid pig that was sandwiched between two large walls...and I decided to call it quits.&#xA0; So I powered down the Playbook, and got up to get a drink from the kitchen.&#xA0; However, when I got up, the hyperflexion hit my upper vertebrae with a massive force and I felt the rest of my spine go &#x201C;click&#x201D; in a chain reaction.&#xA0; My back muscles twisted in response and I suddenly found myself in a world of pain.&#xD;&#xD;I had my daughter walk on my back again, but it only made it worse.&#xA0; I ended up taking some heavy muscle relaxants and pain killers, followed by side-to-side exercises in the pool at the gym, and then I slept in a careful posture for the next 2 days before it finally got better.&#xD;&#xD;Haven&#x2019;t played Angry Birds since.&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xD;Dangerous fucking game.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
