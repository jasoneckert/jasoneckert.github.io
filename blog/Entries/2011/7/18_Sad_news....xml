    <richText>&lt;b&gt;It is with deepest regret that I pass on this news.&#xA0; Our beloved file server, brain, has died at the age of 10.&#xA0; Shawn and I tried our best to get it working today with no avail.&#xA0; Brain was officially pronounced dead at 3:22pm EST (the date the above picture was taken).&#xD;&#xD;For those of you in the SQL class last week, you noticed that brain sometimes needed to be rebooted this past month if we were unable to contact it.&#xA0; And last Thursday, it just wouldn&#x2019;t boot at all.&#xA0; Normally, this isn&#x2019;t a big issue - it usually happens when we turn brain off without properly shutting it down - on the next reboot, it just wants you to press Enter to continue the boot process after doing a file system check.&#xA0; Since brain doesn&#x2019;t have a video card, you must connect remotely using a serial cable from another computer in order to press Enter.&#xD;&#xD;But today, when Shawn and I connected a serial cable between brain and pinky (the other file server in the room) and booted brain, the Linux kernel loaded, but reported hard drive controller errors continuously.&#xA0; We tried to reinstall on another hard disk (in case it was just the hard drive that contained the root file system that was dying), but the installation froze as soon as the driver for the hard disk controller was loaded.&#xA0; We even switched the drives to a new bank (in case it used a different controller) but found out that the entire bank used the same controller.&#xD;&#xD;Brain (a Sun Enterprise 450 with 4 CPUs and 4GB RAM) has served us well for a long time (4 years as a Web server at UW, and 6 years in our IT classroom @ triOS as a file server).&#xA0; It has provided us with the files we needed countless times, allowed us to understand SMB signing options in the Windows registry, as well as served as a database server, Web server, WINS server, and Kerberos Realm for AD integration. It also hosted original text-based adventure games from the 1980s (using the frotz emulator), as well as the infamous WOPR shell scripts from the movie War Games.&#xA0; Rest in peace.&#xD;&#xD;Visitation will be held in Room 1 of the Kitchener campus from 8:00am until 5:00pm Tuesday July 19th and Wednesday July 20th.&#xA0; A brief funeral service will be held in cyberspace on Thursday July 21st, after which brain will be interred and reused as a stand in the front of Room 1.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
