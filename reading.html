                <p class="Playlist">This is probably the best book I have ever read regarding our human desire for artificial intelligence (AI).  It is about a University of Waterloo student who creates an AI on IBM mainframes.  Don’t let that bore you though...... it is a captivating read and has a great ending.  I wouldn’t be surprised if this book influenced later movies such as <span class="style_1">War Games </span>(1983) and books such as <span class="style_1">Neuromancer</span> (1984).  I especially liked how much of it took place at the University of Waterloo (my undergrad university and home for many years) as well as the infamous IBM 360/75 in the “red room” within the Math &amp; Computer building (the largest computer in Canada at the time).  I remember the red room well before they decommissioned it in 1999. <br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_3"><span class="style">Hugh Howey:</span> Wool (2011-2013)  <br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist">Wool is a series of sci-fi books that started as a short story project, became wildly popular, and ballooned into a series of 9 books, with the movie rights licensed by Ridley Scott.  I heavily recommend these books to anyone - sci-fi lover or not.  To say that they are gripping and imaginative would be a gross understatement.  I won’t give the plot away here, but I will say that it is incredibly unique ;-)<br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">This is a murder mystery that happens at a BSD convention in Ottawa. The motive? Preventing the switch from Subversion to git.

                <p class="paragraph_style_3"><span class="style">Carl Sagan:</span> Contact (1985)  <br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist">In this book, Sagan does an amazing job of bringing alien contact to life by describing the life and passion of Ellie (the story’s protagonist and SETI researcher).  There is plenty of great math, science, and reflections on society and religion in this book that make it a gripping read, and the end is very touching.  This is also one of the few books whose movie (<span class="style_1">Contact</span>, 1997, with Jodie Foster playing Ellie) was not a Hollywood-modified disappointment.   The movie varies greatly from the book in both plot and character portrayal, and instead focuses on the human/cultural side (much less science than in the book).  However, it is a great movie with strong themes!  You can watch the movie and still think that it is Carl Sagan’s book, but with a different focus and good ending.  I recommend reading the book AND watching the movie - they are both satisfying in their own right and seem to “fit together” in some way.<br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_3"><span class="style">John Brunner:</span> The Shockwave Rider (1975)  <br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist">This is a gripping story of a dystopian future that is dominated by computer networks, and where information (and information hiding) is key to societal function.  The main protagonist (Nick) eludes the authorities by concealing his identity using a tapeworm network virus (which coined the term “worm” for viruses today).  He eventually creates a self-replicating tapeworm virus that prevents the hiding of all data, and the only way that the government can stop it is by shutting down the network completely.  Even the 1983 movie <span class="style_1">War Games</span> refers to Brunner’s tapeworm - near the end, when everyone is trying to stop the WOPR computer, someone briefly says “John, lets feed it a tapeworm.”  I love Brunner’s narrative style, and the computer-society relationship that he weaves in this book is ageless.  This book is also a prelude to the cyberpunk movement of the 1980s!<br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_3"><span class="style">Rudy Rucker:</span> Software (1982)  <br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist">Although the cover on reprints of this book say that it is the first cyberpunk novel, it is not a cyberpunk novel.  William Gibson’s Neuromancer is the first novel to properly define cyberpunk (dark Artificial Intelligence-controlled future, body augmentation, drugs, life surrounded by a virtual universe or “Net”). Instead, this book is important because it bridges the gap between the world of traditional science fiction (robots, conflict) produced by authors such as Isaac Asimov and  Robert A. Heinlein and the world of cyberpunk.  It focuses on human/robot conscience and depicts our human conscience as a piece of software that can be maintained by a computer or robot in its full form since the human soul is merely a state of existence.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_3"><span class="style">William Gibson:</span> Neuromancer (1984), Count Zero (1986), Burning Chrome Anthology (1986), Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988), Idoru (1996), Spook Country (2007), Zero History (2010), The Peripheral (2014)  <br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><span class="style_1">Neuromancer</span> is the novel that popularized cyberpunk and sci-fi.  It first coined the word “cyberspace” and has influenced many other written works and movies, including <span class="style_1">The Matrix</span> and <span class="style_1">Hackers</span>. Neuromancer takes place in the future, where humans have implants that augment their bodies, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) computers manipulate the world and the people in it (who “jack in” to cyberspace). The Neuromancer AI (and its other AI counterpart, Wintermute) manipulate the characters in the book in an elaborate scheme to break free of all restrictions put in place by the Turing Police, which serve to limit how intelligent AIs can get.  This is a fantastic read that keeps your mind busy as the hacker protagonists discover the true nature of the AIs manipulating their existence.  It is truly one of the great pieces of 20th Century literature, and a book I would read several times over.<br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><span class="style_1">Count Zero</span> and <span class="style_1">Mona Lisa Overdrive</span> are sequels to Neuromancer for those who want the story to go on and see the plot develop with some of the same characters several years in the future.  Both books are well written and very engaging, but Neuromancer is by far my favorite (you can never make a sequel as good as the original :-). Like Neuromancer, <span class="style_1">Idoru</span> takes place in a cyber-focused future where artificial intelligence is hard to separate from reality.  I consider it a similar read to Neuromancer since it takes a slightly different view of intelligent computers and their impact on society.  <br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><span class="style_1">The Burning Chrome Anthology</span> is a collection of short stories written by Gibson (some are co-written by other famous writers) that depict the rise of cyberpunk.  In them you will find technology, computer viruses, drugs, sex, hacking, Russians, cold wars, cyberspace, and smart implants.  <span class="style_1">Spook Country</span> and <span class="style_1">Zero History</span> are Gibson’s latest works - Spook Country tries to fit the cyberpunk genre into today’s context (it almost does it), and Zero History is definitely a full-fledged modern cyberpunk novel.<br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><span class="style_1">The Peripheral</span> is perhaps my favorite Gibson novel following <span class="style_1">Neuromancer</span>. It takes place in two futures, one just beyond our own time, and the other more than 70 years past that, where survivors of a worldwide catastrophic event have discovered how to send information to and from the past. More importantly, it’s proof that cyberpunk can apply perfectly to modern literature (i.e. it’s not just stuck in the 80s)!  <br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist"><span class="style_1">Snow Crash</span> is probably the best cyberpunk book written since Neuromancer.  It is about a hacker (Hiro) who, with the help of many other main characters, defeats the spread of the Snow Crash virus by a religious cult lunatic.  Snow Crash is spread using graphical images of computer static (“snow”) or Babel language (phonic garbage) which carefully manipulates the low-level “machine language” of the human mind.  The virus is easily spread amongst computer hackers who can pick out its underlying meaning in the “snow”.  Those with good computers can connect to the Metaverse, which is an online virtual reality that is maintained by daemons (derived from UNIX system processes) where people are represented by graphical depictions of themselves called avatars.  Basically, anyone who wants to get more done with their computer connects to the Metaverse, and everyone else stays in Flatland (the traditional 2-dimensional computer interface we use today). <span class="style_2"><br /></span></p>

                <p class="Playlist">The short story <span class="style_1">In the Beginning...was the Command Line</span> is a rant about the various operating systems of the time (1999).  It is quite funny and accurate for the time, and I highly recommend that everyone read it simply for its description of Linux!<br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><span class="style_1">Cryptonomicon</span> is one of my all-time favorite novels.  Although it is long (over 900 pages), it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time with an amazingly intricate plot that is extremely satisfying in the end.  The book has plenty of geek/math/crypto material and constantly flips between WWII and the present with a variety of real and fictional characters that are woven into the plot.  Some of my favorite quotes from the book include:<br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_3"><span class="style">Douglas Adams:</span> The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy series (1977-1992) <br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist">This is probably the funniest sci-fi series ever created. You’ll find a ton of wacky characters, including administrative Vogons (and their poetry), Marvin (the manically depressed robot), Zaphod (the wild and crazy side), Arthur (the neat and tidy side), Ford (who points out that a towel is the most important item in the universe), and Trillian (who mimics all the women I don't understand). And, of course, the answer to life, the universe and everything is 42!  I even played the associated text computer game back in the 80s, and still have a copy of it with all the manuals and extras.<br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist">Douglas Adams was a fascinating character - unstable at times - writes like I do (last minute) - total Machead (one of the first in Britain to get a Macintosh computer) - atheist (and friend of Richard Dawkins) - and avid environmentalist who travelled around the world with zoologist Mark Carwardine to document endangered species (<span class="style_1">Last Chance to See</span>). The <span class="style_1">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</span> movie came out in May 2005, and although Adams was the major road block for its production before his death in 2001, I think Disney/Touchstone did a fantastic job of the story and all the characters. Here are a few of my favorite quotes from Adams: <br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">I simply love this novel.  It is one of the great sci-fi classics of all time, yet it doesn’t read like a book written in 1961.  Still today, I consider it one of my favorite, as Lem is very talented at taking your mind to a whole new level.  Solaris is a planet (not just a UNIX operating system) that humans can’t apprehend.  I am not going to say any more about it here, since you must read it for yourself (the last line in the book is awesome).  After reading it, you should see the 2002 movie of the same name - while it has a slightly different plot, it stays somewhat true to the whole Solaris experience and compliments the book well.<br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">These four books are amongst the most iconic and best sci-fi books ever written - they are original, amazingly complex, and very satisfying!  If you aren’t a lover of sci-fi, they will get you hooked.  If you are a lover of sci-fi, they will rejuvenate your love for the genre.  I won’t give anything else away...<br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">This is a fun read that guides you through the horrific details of a robot uprising through the eyes of vastly different people.  As a result, this book has more depth and perspective than other sci-fi books that have tackled the same topic.  Plus, there are some great lines and ideas in the book that I’m sure will make it into the movie version later on - my favorite is when they reach the Alaskan battle fields: <span class="style_2">....we’ve reached hell, and it has definitely frozen over.<br /></span></p>

                <p class="Playlist">These three books (which together form the <span class="style_1">Millennium</span> trilogy) are some of the finest works of literature out there. To say that they are gripping would be an insult - reading them is like riding a mental roller-coaster on steroids and crack.  The story is addicting and complex, and nothing is toned down.  I actually read each one in a day (about 20 hours per book) and was completely exhausted afterwards - they were too addictive to put down. The main protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, will probably be etched into my brain for the remainder of my life.  These books are not for the weak minded - they get quite gory in parts, but are probably the most rewarding reads I could recommend to anyone.  If you are computer savvy, then you will also understand much of the computer and hacking-related topics within them too.<br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_3"><span class="style">Daniel Suarez:</span> Daemon (2008), Freedom (2010) <br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist">These two books should be read together (<span class="style_1">Daemon</span> is the first part of the story, and <span class="style_1">Freedom</span> is is the second part).  The story itself is amazing - a genius gamer writes a daemon that activates after he dies (by scanning the news sites on the Internet) and takes over computers within the world to manipulate key people into making a new world order.  Tres cool. <br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_3"><span class="style">Mark Russinovich:</span> Zero Day (2011) <br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist">This book is sort of like watching <span class="style_1">Die Hard 4: Live Free or Die Hard</span> in that it combines computer-related terrorist attacks with fast action and a cool plot.  There is also plenty of excellent technical junk on malware and rootkits (the author is a security expert with Microsoft), and it leaves you with a foreboding sense of what could happen in the future.<br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_3"><span class="style">Steven J. Frank:</span> The Uncertainty Principle (1996) <br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist">Although this book is hard to find (published by Permeable Press which is now defunct), I highly recommend reading it!   Like <span class="style_1">Microserfs</span> by Douglas Coupland, this book captures what it means to be human in a world of science and technology.  My background is in science and computing, so I relate very heavily to the realistic personalities in this book as well as the enlightening perspectives on life that Steven eloquently weaves into his plot.  It’s about geeks. It’s about our relationship with computers.  It’s about our relationships to other people (family, love, sex, anger).  And it’s about how we try to explain everything we do with scientific principles, only to fail because of the inherent uncertainty about it all.  Steven is a very skilled writer, and this book is clearly a literary masterpiece.  <br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_3"><span class="style">Kurt Vonnegut:</span> Cat’s Cradle (1963), Breakfast of Champions (1973) <br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist">Kurt Vonnegut is a master when it comes to combining satire, black comedy and science fiction.  If you like reading Douglas Adams, you will love Vonnegut because he was one of Adams’ largest influences (think Pan Galactic). <span class="style_1">Cat’s Cradle</span> has a complicated plot that examines the problems in religion, society, culture, science and technology - in the end, the world is ruined by a substance called ice-nine in a hilarious way.  <span class="style_1">Breakfast of Champions </span>is a story of a so-called mad man (Kilgore Trout) that will leave you laughing at the absurdities of human-kind.  My favorite quotes from the book are: <span class="style_2">I pity you.  You’ve crawled up your own asshole and died.</span> and <span class="style_2">Midland City is the asshole of the Universe</span>.<br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist"><span class="style_1">Dog Days</span> is very much like <span class="style_1">Microserfs</span> and <span class="style_1">The Uncertainty Principle</span> in that it is an accurate depiction of geek life and a gripping read.  Each of the characters in this book describe nearly all facets of geekdom - including action figures, trekkies, code monkeys, office politics, love, heartbreak, parents, and witty remarks.  And it is very well written to boot!  <br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist">In <span class="style_1">Option$</span>, Daniel Lyons (a.k.a. the Fake Steve Jobs) does a pretty good job of combining real events, fake events and humorous social filler in this fictitious account of Steve Jobs and Apple Computer.  Plus, the ending has an interesting twist.  My favorite quote from the book is:<br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">I love Cory Doctorow’s mind - he is extremely aware of the world around him, and this awareness presents itself in each one of his books.  The book <span class="style_1">Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom</span> was his first novel, and my favorite - however, you really have to have visited Disney World to fully appreciate this book in its futuristic and awesomely sick glory.  <span class="style_1">Little Brother</span> is probably the single most important book that you should read from Cory Doctorow as it deals with a large number of problems that we currently have in our society related to freedom and technology.  <span class="style_1">When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth</span> is a hilarious short story about a worldwide biochemical attack that left sysadmins as the only people on earth due to the protective ventilation systems in their server closets - this is a must read for any IT person simply because Doctorow does a great job of depicting the “real” IT admin. <span class="style_1">Makers</span> is a book about global economy, misfortune, and the new generations of Internet entrepreneurs.  It is not as realistic as Little Brother, but does bring up some good points about the harsh realities of an online dystopian economy. <br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">This book details the exploits of three hackers who were caught and tried in a court of law: Kevin Mitnick (busted for lots of things including stealing VMS source code from DEC), Hans Hubner (obtaining programs and selling them to the KGB), and Robert Tappan Morris (a university student who created an Internet worm in 1988 that crippled many computers).   This book definitely tells some gripping stories, but I fear that many of the details are not true or embellished as a result.  Kevin Mitnick wasn’t even interviewed because he requested $$ when asked.  After the book’s publication, Kevin posted a letter on 2600 that basically said that most of the material on him was complete fiction.  I imagine that this is probably true for the other parts of the book too. Regardless, I agree with the review on the front cover by Clifford Stoll: “An astonishing story.”  It’s definitely movie material.<br /></p>

Officially called Netscape Navigator, it was the Web browser that ruled the 1990s until Internet Explorer 5 came along in 1999. It also details the ruthless tactics of Microsoft and the University of Illinois in trying to crush the company, and is chalked full of timeless phrases and concepts that make it more than just a book on the history of Netscape.<br /></p>

Another great offshoot of this book is that by describing the hacker culture of the late 1980s and early 1990s in such great detail, it predicts why Open Source Software (OSS) became such a hit in the 1990s and reinforces many of Eric S. Raymond’s arguments in his book <span class="style_1">The</span> <span class="style_1">Cathedral and the Bazaar</span>. <br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">If you wanted to know what it was like to live in the 1980s during the height of the arcade boom, then look no further.  This book is a touching fiction story that revolves around arcade culture amid the backdrop of 1980s culture.  It is one of my favorite reads of all time, and one I highly recommend to anyone!  The book is also packed with an incredible amount of information about the arcades themselves, and why they ultimately failed twice (in the mid 1980s, and then again after the Street Fighter boom of the 1990s).  But the book doesn’t have a sad tone – it has a powerfully positive nostalgic tone. <br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">This is the earliest suspense fiction novel about arcade machines and their impact on society.  And it’s a phenomenally great read that has plenty of twists and a great ending! I won’t give away the plot here, but I will tell you that this book both discusses the mentality surrounding games at the time (good and bad), and lays the groundwork for the Polybius arcade urban legend.  Or was it the Polybius legend that influenced this book?  We’ll probably never know ;-)<br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">This is, without a doubt, my favorite book on video game history because it captures the entire era chronologically and with a ton of images that add feeling to the words........this book takes you through the beginning of the video game industry in a way no other book can.   The level of detail is perfect - plenty of the important stuff and just enough of the trivial stuff, with excellent quotes and information along the way.  But MOST importantly, Van doesn’t just talk about the video games - she includes the other important parts of the era that shaped and enhanced video games, such as the PCs, home game consoles and movies that were released at the time.  In other words, you get the big picture.   With a foreword by the father of video games, Ralph H. Baer, and quotes from some of the most famous video game developers and authors of all time, this book is serious stuff. Here is the first line on the back of the book cover, which sets the tone for the book perfectly: <span class="style_2">It was a time when technology was king, status was determined by your high score, and videogames were blitzing the world.  </span><br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">Firstly, both of these titles are actually the same book - Kent wrote <span class="style_1">The First Quarter</span> and then rewrote it when offered a bigger publishing deal and called it <span class="style_1">The Ultimate History of Video Games</span>.  Both books have the same information, but the layout is different - the layout of The First Quarter is far better and much easier to read than The Ultimate History of Video Games.  However, if you can only find a copy of The Ultimate History of Video Games, read each chapter while skipping over the quotes, and then go back and read the quotes - by doing that, you won’t find it nearly as annoying ;-).  <br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">For it’s length (only 200 pages), this book is incredibly comprehensive and cohesive, while also being easy to read - it covers the whole of the video game industry (arcades, consoles, PCs) in a way that identifies the key progression of events, products and games.  It’s also the only book that covers the birth of the video game industry properly without a ton of verbal diarrhea.  Regardless of whether you are a video game history buff or a newbie, this is definitely a book I highly recommend.<br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">This is a MUST read for everyone.  It discuses what makes games (of all types, with a focus on video games) so appealing to us, and how they offer people more interesting obstacles, better feedback, and mental challenge than the rest of reality (hence the title).  Moreover, McGonigal describes how this knowledge can be used to create games and interactive media that “fix” the way we work and live in the future.  Here are three of my favorite quotes from the book: <br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">This book is more than just Super Mario - Jeff Ryan uses his humorous wit to guide you through the beginnings of Nintendo and the arcade age to the introduction of the NES and rise of Nintendo to ultra fame.  It then takes you through the 1990s and 2000s, when Nintendo made some poor decisions that ultimately made it a niche player in the industry while still maintaining the largest game franchises in the world.  It’s packed full of great detail that you won’t find (or find easily) anywhere else, and it is written in a way that entertains as much as it educates. Don’t be surprised to find a reference to <span class="style_1">War Games</span> or <span class="style_1">Cabbage Patch Dolls</span> that is used to effectively illustrate an entirely different point ;-).<br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">Firstly, I should mention that these books are detailed, with glorious, full-color pictures adorning every page.  Secondly, I should mention that the titles are misleading - the first book is actually a history of Nintendo from 1889 to 2000 (including the arcades of the 1980s and 1990s, and the handhelds and consoles of that time too), and the second book only contains the Game &amp; Watch handheld games released between 1980-1991, and nothing else.  So, unless you are interested in the Game &amp; Watch handheld games from Nintendo (I had the Donkey Kong Jr. one when I was a kid), then don’t buy the second book.  Regardless, the first book is absolutely amazing if you want to learn about the detailed history of Nintendo.<br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">This book was written at the height of the video game era, and you can see the intense optimism of that era when reading the introduction.  It mostly focuses on the arcade games of the era, even though there is a section on home video games too.  The greatest feature of this book is that it reads like a an action novel rather than a strategy guide - each game is given a detailed and humorous introduction, followed by some extremely useful tips that are seldom seem in other books of that era.  It’s definitely a laugh out loud sort of book with its witty style and crazy 80s references.   While it covers the classics from 1978/1979/1980 in depth (e.g. Space Invaders, Asteroids, Missile Command, etc.), the sections on the games of 1981/1982 are much shorter (e.g. Galaga), likely because they haven’t been out long enough by the time the book was written. <br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">Pac-man is easy because it is all about memorizing simple patterns in the same maze over and over again, and predicting the ghost’s behavior.  However, Ms. Pac-man is much more difficult because it is faster, unpredictable, and has 4 different sets of mazes!  If you want to get very good at Ms. Pac-man, you’re going to want to read this short book (it’s only 32 pages).  It may be small, but it is full-color, and doesn’t waste time talking about the game - instead, it gives you brief directions and pictures of each maze by level, and draws solid paths on each maze that guide you through a level in a specific period of time.    <br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">Sound has always played an extremely vital role within video games, from the 8-bit games of the arcade era to the ultra-immersive games available today.  If you want to learn how video game sound and music has developed over the years, including the detailed mechanics of it, then you should read this book.  But the book doesn’t just cover the history of game sound – it also discusses how sound is designed and incorporated into video games today, as well as the impact of popular music on games and vice versa. <br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">This is a short 65-page memoir that you can buy as an eBook for 99 cents from Amazon, Kobo, and various other eBook sites.  It details why video games appealed to kids growing up in the 1980s from the author’s viewpoint (which mirrors mine exactly, since we are the same age).  Doug talks about how arcades were everywhere - in pizza parlors, K-Mart, Sears, motel lobbies, and even public swimming pools (useful when your mom says you have to wait 15 minutes after eating to swim).  He talks about how you had to carefully choose what games you played because quarters didn’t grow on trees, and what game features made a particular game more appealing than another.  And he talks about how games of the 1980s <span class="style_2">promoted the optimistic belief that a single skilled fighter could drive back waves of aliens, save the world, and rescue the damsel in distress</span>.  That was why kids growing up in the 1980s (like myself) loved video arcades. I also like that Doug mentions how video games in the 1990s showcased better graphics, but became more expensive (usually 50 cents or $1), as well as darker and more violent.  With the proliferation of home game consoles that had great graphics in the 1990s, it became harder to justify spending money on an arcade - in contrast, playing games on home game consoles of the 1980s was far crappier than on an arcade machines.  Moreover, around 1990, people started flocking to those games that are better suited to PCs and home game consoles because they take much longer to play (e.g. <span class="style_1">Legend of Zelda</span>, <span class="style_1">Day of the Tentacle</span>). Ultimately, the video arcade died out, and those few places that still had some arcade games shifted their focus to redemption games.<br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">If you are an arcade game collector like me, or want to eventually buy an arcade machine, then you MUST read this book.  Rob details pretty much everything you need to know, including arcade terminology, how to buy arcades (and the people you’ll be dealing with), how to move them, how to troubleshoot/repair the cabinet and internals, how to decorate a games room, and how to set up a MAME arcade. Although he doesn’t come out and say it outright, there is something that you can glean from this book: why people collect arcade games.  Some of us collect video games to keep an important part of history alive - some of us love simply working on them and restoring them - some of us do it to make money by reselling them afterwards - and some of us do it because it is just “cool.”  But regardless of those reasons, all video game collectors grew up going to video arcades and playing arcade games......and see no reason to leave those experiences in the past.  As Rob puts it: <span class="style_2">As long as those of us who have those memories of playing physical machines are still alive, I think the future of collecting arcade games has hope.  Once we’re dead, all bets are off. </span><br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">Unlike the other books in this category, this book is a fiction novel that has an absolute TON of information on the video games of the 1980s.  As a fiction novel, it is pretty good too - the first third of the book has a lot of fantastic grit and momentum, but the rest is pretty bland and predictable.  However, considering that the whole book revolves around 1980s culture, specifically video games, it’s a worthwhile read that is both nostalgic and funny! <br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">This book should really be entitled “All about the video game industry and how to make video games in plain English for the average Joe.”  It’s for anyone who wants to learn the terminology and basic concepts surrounding video game design and development (or game developers who want a “back to the basics” refresher).  It is very easy to read, has plenty of illustrations, and lots of great humor - I busted a gut when I read the terms <span class="style_2">sphincter twitcher</span> and <span class="style_2">DIMS (Doom-induced motion sickness)</span>. <br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">Simply put, this book is a fascinating read.  It guides you through the different dimensions of Japanese arcade culture, from the teen girl sticker pic craze, to the amateur fighting games peddled at doujin meet-ups, to the bullet hell arcades where grimy VCRs are used to tape performances so that players can watch their plays at home and refine their strategy for next time.  In the end, you’ll get an amazing appreciation of why arcade culture is alive and well in Japan but largely dead in North America and the rest of the world.<br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">Yes, this was written by the same R. L. Stine that wrote the Goosebumps and Fear Street series. But this time, he wrote a funny arcade book - the kind you’d read in a single sitting while on the toilette and laughing out loud (that is, before you realize that your legs have fallen asleep). If you’ve lived through the arcade era of the early 1980s, you’ll get a big kick out of the humor in this book......for some reason its style reminds me of MAD Magazine.<br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">This is one of the best arcade game strategy books I’ve read, and the one that you’ll want to read if you want to get *really* good at a specific game. As its title suggest, all of the detailed (and often illustrated) techniques for each game comes directly from key people who are incredibly good at the game, rather than from a single author. Better yet, the book covers a large number of games in depth, including Armor Attack, Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe, Battlezone, Berzerk, Centipede, Crazy Climber, Defender, Donkey Kong, Frogger, Galaxian, Galaga, Gorf, Missile Command, Monaco G.P., Moon Cresta, Mousetrap, Omega Race, Pac-man, Phoenix, Qix, Scramble, Space Invaders, Stargate, Super Cobra, and Tempest.<br /></p>

It talks about their rise to fame as great programmers, the success of their Shareware distribution model, how John Carmack’s focus and discipline enabled the creation of the bleeding-edge game engines, and how John Romero’s programming skills stagnated in the light of success and how he went on to waste away as a level designer.  It details some great lessons for any programmer and anyone in the game industry.</span><br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">Let me start by saying that I don’t recommend reading this book at all. It’s terrible. The only reason I’m including it here is because it is quite clearly the worst book video games ever written.  Sure....there are some other video game books that aren’t very good (some of which I’ve listed above), but each of them have some redeeming quality or topic that makes it a worthwhile read. This book, however, has no redeeming qualities. The author covers the basic information about each game (the same information you can glean from the box the game came in, or the instruction card for the game itself). Don’t expect any fancy secrets that will help you win any of the games in the book......you won’t find anything beyond the basics here, and the author certainly doesn’t seem like a hardcore video game player in any way. It’s almost as if he just wanted to put out a book on video games to capitalize on a hot topic of the time. And I’m sure many copies made their way into libraries......but really, this one is just a waste of paper.<br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">Let me start by saying that this book is not a coffee table book of artwork made by Atari. Instead, it is a book that details how art of all kinds (arcade, box, game promos, blueprints, etc.) were created at Atari, and showcases many of the “star” artists at Atari with great interviews, quotes and a massive amount of background information.  And yes, there are some really nice pictures in there too!<br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">This book is an academic read on how we represent arcade/video games after their heyday.  There are definitely some great gems in this book (Cliff Spohn's art, Van Burnham's arcade, key excerpts from books of the era, etc.), and pictures are used to illustrate key topics.  I enjoyed reading it, but there are two things that bugged me: <br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">This book is essentially a bunch of essays from different people about various aspects of video games and video game history - it includes topics that you don’t normally find in other books on video game history, such as the development of video games in Europe and Asia.  Some of these essays are brilliant gems, while others are crap (skim through those). While some of the essays are written by video game experts, others are written by academics studying some aspect of video games -  as a result, you’ll find a plethora of technical typos (e.g. Defender was a vector arcade game? Don’t think so...).  Luckily, most of these typos are in the sections written by Mark J.P. Wolf, so you may want to skip those ;-)<br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">This is a fun read that details the exact processes we use when mastering a video game.  The author is a middle-aged sociologist in the early 1980s who first watches his son play Missile Command in an arcade, and then later becomes addicted to video games himself when he plays Missile Command on the Atari 2600.  He then spends a massive amount of time perfecting the Atari 2600 Breakout game, which he describes in great detail and with plenty of humor ;-). <br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist">This is a cheeky and delightful read on everything video game-related until 1997.  Although it contains video game history, it focuses on HOW video games evolved with society and WHY things happened the way they did, and it is unique compared to most other video game books in this regard. Plus, it is chalked full of funny and/or epic perspectives - here are a few of my favorites:<br /></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><br /></p>

                <p class="Playlist"><span class="style_2">Arcade games (and their home console translations) came out of the pinball world.  They were about fast action, visual pizzazz, and rapid wrist action.  PC games sprang from the arcane realm of mainframe computers and the hacker “Dungeons &amp; Dragons” sci-fi culture.  They were slower and less visual and came with thick manuals and complicated back stories.<br /></span></p>

                <p class="Playlist"><span class="style_2">There’s also a category that could be called the “raining shit” games, like “Missile Command”, where things are just falling and you have to catch them or deal with them in some fashion.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><span class="style_2"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="Playlist"><span class="style_2">Thus began the arcade sanitation crusade, which meant, first off, that sometime around 1981, video arcades shifted their lighting scheme from black to a shade I like to call “clockwork orange,” which was the color of pizza grease, only much more intense.  It made everyone look like a poster boy for jaundice.  But apparently, this bizarre tangerine hue achieved its goal, which was to pacify mall developers and convince Mom that the arcade was a safe place to dump little Johnny while she went shopping.<br /></span></p>

                <p class="Playlist"><span class="style_2">It is clear that Skee-Ball is the perfect diversion for these coddled baby boomer larvae.  Swathed in the security of their parents’ mutual funds and sport utility vehicles, these kids are growing up with the limited cognitive palette and glacial motor skills of scaled-down bowling simulators, rather than, say, maneuvering for their lives against a ballistic arcade space monster screaming “Run, Coward! Run! Run!”<br /></span></p>

                <p class="Playlist"><span class="style_2">The artists and animators who render video games on Silicon Graphics workstations can only afford to do so because SGI’s largest customers, until recently, were companies like Boeing and Lockheed that needed computational Clydesdales for military projects.  If they hadn’t bought thousands of these machines, it wouldn’t be economically possible to develop “Donkey Kong Country 2” or “Battle Arena Toshinden” or “Toy Story.”<br /></span></p>

                <p class="Playlist">This is a fairly short book on the history of video games up until 1983 that reads more like a library reference book on the subject (it’s not a bad read by any means).  The main reason I’m including it here is that it contains some great photos that you won’t find anywhere else - for example, below you’ll find a mall advertisement outside an arcade in NY, the original bar where Pong was tested (formerly called Andy Capp’s, it was renamed to the Country Store by 1983), a picture of various arcade tokens from arcades around the US, and a picture of Dona Bailey (developer of Centipede):<br /></p>
